		<h2>a happy conclusion.</h2>
		<p><b>stuck in:</b> my own thoughts</p>
		<p>By the end of it, I was still worried. The 2.5 hours flew by so quickly and in relative, peaceful silence, save the birds chirping, the leaves rustling, and the hordes of mosquitos that were ceaselessly attacking us. Everyone was working on their own html documents, and all I could think was, "oh no, people are going to think this was the worst, most boring event ever!!" </p>
		<p>But I forget that fun doesn't have to be loud or fast! Joy can be found in the slow labour with our hands. Wasn't that what I loved about HTML? That it felt like building a little piece of the web that can represent me. And when people asked whether I'd host another one, or told me that they had fun, or that they enjoyed spending the time outside coding, it made my heart so, very full.</p>
		<p>I told someone I felt like an art teacher during the event, and I mean it in the best way possible. I loved going around to see what everyone was making, each one unique to their own interests and personalities. I think half the people in attendance were first-time HTML coders, how exciting is that? It's like being able to share this little joy I have with someone, and watching them make it their own.</p>
