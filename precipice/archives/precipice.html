	<h2>aka <mark>the landing page for the personal corner of this website</mark></h2>
	
	<p>The precipice was mainly named that because I like the sound of the world, and it just felt <i>right</i> somehow to call the personal corner of this website a precipice. In a way, like an edge to jump over into the unknown, to lose yourself in the slow growing trails I'm leaving behind as I add more to this corner of the website. I guess with a "personal" site, I feel freer to create whatever pages I want. It doesn't have to serve a public-facing purpose like my main page; it can be whatever I want it to be, for myself only. This is probably the oldest page on the website I've coded, since it was the first page I made for the original beansontoast Neocities website.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — ???</h3>
	<p>I'd apparently picked out the colours from the sleeping red panda photo I use as my display picture for are.na. (I don't actually remember this, but this is what I have written from 27 May 2022 in one of my notebooks). The photo is from my trip to the zoo, where we spotted a red panda high up in the trees taking a well-deserved nap. Originally, the page had been in French, because I was learning the language at that time, but it felt disingenuous to continue having it up in French because I was nowhere past being an absolute beginner in the language. On the page itself, I detail why I even started my personal website.</p>

	<p>The page itself is simple, unabashedly based on <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template. The responsive aspect of the design was straightforward, I didn't have to do anything special as the <code>div</code> elements are set to resize on their own.</p>
