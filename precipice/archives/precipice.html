	<h1><span class="sketch-highlight">precipice</span></h1>
	<h2>aka <mark>the landing page for the personal corner of this website</mark></h2>
	
	<p>The precipice was mainly named that because I like the sound of the world, and it just felt <i>right</i> somehow to call the personal corner of this website a precipice. In a way, like an edge to jump over into the unknown, to lose yourself in the slow growing trails I'm leaving behind as I add more to this corner of the website. I guess with a "personal" site, I feel freer to create whatever pages I want. It doesn't have to serve a public-facing purpose like my main page; it can be whatever I want it to be, for myself only. This is probably the oldest page on the website I've coded, since it was the first page I made for the original beansontoast Neocities website.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — august 2024</h3>
	<p>I'd apparently picked out the colours from the sleeping red panda photo I use as my display picture for are.na. (I don't actually remember this, but this is what I have written from 27 May 2022 in one of my notebooks). The photo is from my trip to the zoo, where we spotted a red panda high up in the trees taking a well-deserved nap. Originally, the page had been in French, because I was learning the language at that time, but it felt disingenuous to continue having it up in French because I was nowhere past being an absolute beginner in the language. On the page itself, I detail why I even started my personal website.</p>

	<p>The page itself is simple, unabashedly based on <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template. The responsive aspect of the design was straightforward, I didn't have to do anything special as the <code>div</code> elements are set to resize on their own.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.1 › august 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>Between August 2024 and September 2024, a lot of design changes happened to the page! One of the biggest visual changes were the colours: they were previously too low contrast,a and I increased their contrast for visibility purposes.</p>
	<p>Although the main layout remained the same, I kept shuffling things around and adding new sections. This came about because I was rapidly adding new content and new pages to my personal site. Because of that, I felt like I needed a better way to manage the links to these pages. The way I had it previously: an <code>inline</code> set of links felt too cluttered and not visually distinct enough. While it worked for a minimal number of links, when I added too many it felt hard to read and identify where to go. I initially settled on adding a mini sitemap to the bottom of the page, while shifting this style of inline links to the top of the page. This remained the design for awhile, until I decided to revamp it again in September 2024.</p>
	<figure>
	<img src="images/precipice-v1p1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of my front page. With a similar layout to version 1, the distinct visual differences are increased colour contrasts and more content.">
	<figcaption><span>Version 1.1 of the landing page for my personal site.</span> With increased contrast in colours, a less cluttered section of quick (inline) links and a somewhat organized set of navigation links for the personal side of this domain.

	</figure>
	<p>I was never fully satisfied with how the sitemap looked because it again felt too cluttered and hard to read. In the end, I decided to create an entirely separate sitemap page that includes pages from my professional pages and other miscellaneous links on this domain, while just keeping an extensive navigation to the pages on my personal section of the site. I also reduced the number of inline links at the top of the page to a few key ones.</p>
	<p>In my revamp in August, I also added an explanation of why there was a separate precipice corner on my professional site, and added a changelog! This was a nice way to have an overview of what I did to the website over time, but released in a monthly fashion rather than instantaneously as most changelogs might be. The monthly summary of updates are again inspired by <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">100r.co</a>'s monthly updates that chronicles how their website (and other projects) change after each month.</p>
