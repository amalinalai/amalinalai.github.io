	<p>Before this website, I've had a myriad of other webpages, now long lost to my habit of deleting things I no longer thought relevant in my life. My first interest in web design and coding started with my first blog on <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a> when I was around the age of ten. I cycled through a few different blogs, deleting them when I wanted to dispose of that identity I had crafted for myself.</p>
	
	<h3>the 2010s...</h3>
	<p>When I was thirteen or so, I apparently had a <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> where I posted a single piece of writing. I'd completely forgotten about it until I received an email about its impending deletion due to its inactivity about a decade later. Years later, I moved to <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>. I had a website for my writing, another for my art portfolio (as part of a school assignment), and a final one which I used to privately write about my various opinions on different matters. They were soon deleted after many years, when I decided I wanted to keep my writing truly private and to myself. And through all these formative years of my life, I was also active on <a href="https://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. With Wordpress, I didn't quite have the flexibility I had with Blogger in terms of how my blog looked like, which I think was one of the grievances I had towards the platform.</p>
	
	<p>Later on, I found out about <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, and coded a webpage for my art portfolio. That was later taken down too, for reasons I can't quite remember. For years after, my only internet presence came in the form of my Instagram account — open to few close friends only. I would use it as a journaling space of sorts; somewhere to write my thoughts and how I feel, chronicle my days, or even just post photos I wanted to keep.</p>
	
	
	<h3>the 2020s...</h3>
	<p>At the end of 2021, I decided to leave the platform. Doing so, I dedicated my time towards <a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> instead, where I found a place of nourishment and a safehaven to explore and collect ideas. I found myself with a deep-seated regret at not being a better archivist of my digital self, though I could not blame myself. And through the rabbit holes I followed on are.na, I reconnected with my desire to handcode websites in purely CSS and HTML — a callback to my childhood coding layouts for blogger.</p>

	<p>I think I had another <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github page</a> at some point (the same platform I'm currently hosting this website on), but it was shortlived. In 2022, I made another Neocities account, this time with the intention to share the space with my partner. We'd called it beansontoast, and I poured time into making a few pages for the site. Thinking it was a cute idea that beans on toast could also mean cat beans on toast, i.e. a cat paw on a piece of toast, I made a little front page which had a toast image with a cat paw sticking out from the corner of the image. On hover, this image would change to one where the cat paw is closer to said toast, as though it was reaching out.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>Some of the pages you see on this current domain (<a href="/precipice/map">map of the internet</a>, <a href="/precipice/bookshelf">bookshelf</a> and <a href="precipice/toybox">toybox</a>) were part of that Neocities website. I had every intention to teach my partner to code his space on the website, but it never really did come to fruition. Moreover, I think I didn't quite like how Neocities publicised everytime you made a change on your website, and how it tallied up the number of views you had to your page. In the end, I decided to take the website down, but not before downloading its contents.</p>
	
	<p>Just before the end of that website's life, this came to be. This was originally intended to be a purely professional website, but I decided to upload whatever I had made for beansontoast onto this, carving this little corner of the internet for myself. I think what had bothered me too at that time was feeling like my digital presence was highly fragmented and all over the place, which was another factor that had pushed me to delete the beansontoast website. In the end, allowing both my professional and personal sides to coexist on this single domain felt like a comforting resolution to whatever I was feeling.</p>
	
	<h3>welcome to the archives!!</h3>
	<p>As I said, a part of me felt deeply regretful for not having better chronicled all previous iterations of my digital presence, and I wanted to remedy that with this one. I am reminded of how personal websites I used to visit when I was younger sometimes had a page dedicated to their site's old layouts. I wanted to do something similar for mine: this is where you find yourself right now. An archive to chronicle the history of most pages on this site and how they've looked like and changed over time. With that, I also wanted to document the inspiration, impetus and sometimes process of creating the layouts I have.</p>
	
	<p>For additional context, the entire website is static, hand-coded and will rely minimally on anything beyond CSS and HTML. Expect solutions that are pure HTML & CSS, instead of Javascript-dependent ones, for things I wish to implement in my layouts.</p>
