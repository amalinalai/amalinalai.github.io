	<p>Hello, you've found the corner of my website chronicling how pages here change and develop over time.</p>
	<p>The Archives works in tandem with the <a href="/compost">compost</a> pile of this site, which hosts some of the older designs of the pages you'll find featured here. I've named it compost because of the cyclical nature of composting, where old decomposing matter becomes a source of sustenance for new life.</p>
	<h1><span class="sketch-highlight">prelude</span></h1>
	<h2>aka <mark>what came before</mark> & <mark>why this exists</mark></h2>
	
	<p>Before this website, I've had a myriad of other webpages, now long lost to my habit of deleting things I no longer thought relevant in my life. My first interest in web design and coding started with my first blog on <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a> when I was around the age of ten. I cycled through a few different blogs, deleting them when I wanted to dispose of that identity I had crafted for myself.</p>
	
	<h3>the 2010s...</h3>
	<p>When I was thirteen or so, I apparently had a <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> where I posted a single piece of writing. I'd completely forgotten about it until I received an email about its impending deletion due to its inactivity about a decade later. When I was around fourteen or fifteen, I moved to <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>. I had a website for my writing, another for my art portfolio (as part of a school assignment), and a final one which I used to privately write about my various opinions on different matters. They were soon deleted after many years, when I decided I wanted to keep my writing truly private and to myself. And through all these formative years of my life, I was also active on <a href="https://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, having multiple blogs and sideblogs dedicated to different interests I had at that time. With Wordpress, I didn't quite have the flexibility I had with Blogger in terms of how my blog looked like, which I think was one of the grievances I had towards the platform.</p>
	
	<p>Later on, I found out about <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, and coded a webpage for my art portfolio. That was later taken down too, for reasons I can't quite remember. For years after, my only internet presence came in the form of my Instagram account — open to a few close friends only. I would use it as a journaling space of sorts; somewhere to write my thoughts and how I feel, chronicle my days, or even just post photos I wanted to keep.</p>

	<h3>the 2020s...</h3>
	<p>At the end of 2021, I decided to leave Instagram. My discontent with the platform and its data mining practices, and increasing number of ads and suggested content and an overall dissatisfaction with how it seemed to draw hours of my life away mindlessly scrolling pushed me over the edge. I deleted the application and it was surprisingly easy to let go. After leaving, I dedicated my time towards <a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> instead, where I cultivated a place of nourishment and a safehaven to explore and collect ideas. I found myself with a deep-seated regret at not being a better archivist of my digital self, though I could not blame myself. And through the rabbit holes I followed on are.na, I reconnected with my desire to handcode websites in purely CSS and HTML — a callback to my childhood coding layouts for blogger.</p>
	
	
	<p>I think I had another <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github page</a> at some point (the same platform I'm currently hosting this website on), but it was shortlived. I remember wanting to devote it to my study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Toki Pona</a>, but I had never been good with studying languages anyway, and soon my interest fizzled out, and along with it, the website.  In 2022, I made another Neocities account, this time with the intention to share the space with my partner. We'd called it beansontoast, and I poured time into making a few pages for the site, tending to it like one would a small front garden. Both of us came up with the name, thinking it cute that beans on toast could also mean cat beans on toast, i.e. a cat paw on a piece of toast. In honour of its name, I made a little front page which had a toast image with a cat paw sticking out from the corner of the image. On hover, this image would change to one where the cat paw is closer to said toast, as though it was reaching out.</p>

	<figcaption><span>Front page of beansontoast,</span> the Neocities website I intended to share with my partner. We thought it was cute to have it also mean cat beans (paws).</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>Some of the pages you see on this current domain (<a href="/precipice/map">map of the internet</a>, <a href="/precipice/bookshelf">bookshelf</a> and <a href="precipice/toybox">toybox</a>) were part of that Neocities website. I had every intention to teach my partner to code his space on the website, but it never really did come to fruition due to our busy schedules. Moreover, I didn't quite like how Neocities publicised every time you made a change on your website, and how it tallied up the number of views you had to your page as it made me anxious to see these statistics. In the end, I decided to take the website down with permission from my partner, but not before downloading its contents.</p>
	
	<p>Just before the end of that website's life, this came to be. This was originally intended to be a purely professional website, but I decided to upload whatever I had made for beansontoast onto this, carving this little corner of the internet for myself. I think what had bothered me too at that time was feeling like my digital presence was highly fragmented and all over the place, which was another factor that had pushed me to delete the beansontoast website. In the end, allowing both my professional and personal sides to coexist on this single domain felt like a comforting resolution to whatever I was feeling. I know some people might frown upon having such a deeply personal facet of my life coexist with my front-facing professional image in such close proximity, thinking it "unprofessional", but I live by the ethic that my life and who I am is more than just my work. My entire website is like an open field — free to explore should you please, though not obligated, and ruled by nothing else except my nature. I choose which pages spring from the soil, tend to the ground with my own hands.</p>
	
	<h3>welcome to the archives!!</h3>
	<p>As I said, a part of me felt deeply regretful for not having better chronicled all previous iterations of my digital presence, and I wanted to remedy that with this one. I am reminded of how personal websites I used to visit when I was younger sometimes had a page dedicated to their site's old layouts. I wanted to do something similar for mine: this is where you find yourself right now. An archive to trace the history of most pages on this site and how they've looked like and changed over time. With that, I also want to document the inspiration, impetus and sometimes process behind creating the layouts on this website. This page is for me more than anything, but regardless, I hope you enjoy your stay here.</p>
	
	<p>For additional context, the entire website is static, hand-coded and will rely minimally on anything beyond CSS and HTML. Expect solutions that are pure HTML & CSS, instead of Javascript-dependent ones, for things I wish to implement in my layouts.</p>
