	<p>How often is it that you find links / blogroll pages nowadays? I hadn't really thought about it, until I did. It was a common thing to find on personal blogs in the 2000s to early 2010s. I'd been learning more about webrings and cliques, when I thought about how much old websites used to link to each other. Nowadays, I think it's much harder to find a special page dedicated to outgoing links; in fact, most social media apps and pages tend to want to keep you on the platform, rather than usher you out and beautiful door. Anyway, you can <a href="https://www.are.na/block/29858943">read more of my thoughts on this on my are.na block</a>.</p>

	<p>Still under construction!</p>
	<p>I made my own 88x31 button because of this bus stop page, and it was really fun! The pixel art bunny took me a few hours though, and the rest took a couple more hours, tragically.</p>
