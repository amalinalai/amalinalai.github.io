	<p>How often is it that you find links / blogroll pages nowadays? I hadn't really thought about it, until I did. It was a common thing to find on personal blogs in the 2000s to early 2010s. I'd been learning more about webrings and cliques, when I thought about how much old websites used to link to each other. Nowadays, I think it's much harder to find a special page dedicated to outgoing links; in fact, most social media apps and pages tend to want to keep you on the platform, rather than usher you out and beautiful door. Anyway, you can <a href="https://www.are.na/block/29858943">read more of my thoughts on this on my are.na block</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › aug 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>I don't remember how or why I drew the connection between outgoing links and a bus stop, but it seemed like a fitting connection. My page for outgoing links would be like a bus stop, providing a way to find different landmarks on the internet (i.e. other people's pages and communities!). You could either choose where to go specifically, or let webrings take you to some random website, akin to taking a random bus with no specific direction in mind.</p>

	<p>The single column design was pretty straightforward to do with <code>margin: auto;</code> to center the white divs and <code>max-width</code> with <code>width: 100%;</code> for a quick responsive design. Despite that, I was actually heavily debating between having it be horizontal scrolling (to mimic walking across a space) or vertical scrolling for a long time. I ended up choosing the vertical scrolling (after flip flopping between the two designs) because, although less thematic, worked much better with the heading link jumps.</p>
	<p>The main feature of the page is, of course, a pixel art of a bus stop. As of writing this, I'm still in the midst of working on it! I wanted to pace myself as this was (and still is) the biggest pixel art I've attempted yet. I didn't want to rush myself to finish it, and I think having it develop over time is something nice to be able to look back on. I have the main bus stop mapped out, but slowly adding details to the piece.</p>

	<p>I made a quick repeating tile pixel pattern for the background, meant to look like a (clover) grass field!</p>
	<p>I also my own 88x31 button because of this bus stop page, and it was really fun! The pixel art bunny took me a few hours though, and the rest took a couple more hours, tragically.</p>
