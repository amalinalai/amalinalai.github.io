	<h2>aka <mark>... the bookshelf lol</mark></h2>
	
	<p>The bookshelf, as its name might lead one to deduce, is a place for me to keep track of books I want to read, am reading, and have read. Recently though, these lists have become somewhat outdated and obsolete, as I have a list written on a physical whiteboard by my bed.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — 2023</h3>
	<p>The layout was heavily inspired by Nico Chilla's are.na channel, <a href="https://www.are.na/nico-chilla/website-as-a-collection-of-boxes"><i>website as a collection of boxes</i></a> which houses links to different websites whose layout consists of rectangles, often arranged in some ordered, grid-like fashion. Moreover, I'd chosen to write the contents of the webpage in Malay, a language I'd spent half my life studying in school but still struggling to understand and use. This choice to use a non-English language was inspired by <a href="http://tiana.land/">Tiana Dueck's page</a> written in Dutch and her motivation behind it. I hope to someday become better at Malay, and I have every intention of writing more of my pages in Malay.</p>
	
	<p>My own rendition was simply four square boxes stacked in two rows and two columns to form another, larger square. I'd achieved this using the <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code> property on the outer container <code>div</code>. In the event where the screen size got too small, the square boxes would reorganize themselves into a single column. I had a lot of help from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">css-tricks' guide to flexbox</a> while figuring out flexboxes.</p>

	<p>Within my to-read list, I'd tried to make the list look like stacked books with a few <code>inline div</code> elements. Although it works, I think I could find a way to execute this better.</p>

	<h3>version 1.5 › 2023 — ???</h3>
	<p>When 2023 came around, I didn't know how to include both my 2022 and 2023 lists of books I've read without it being overwhelming, long and hard to scroll through in such a tiny box. I ended up simply removing the books I've read section. A part of me really wants to re-do this entire page; I rarely update my webpages and so the part of what books I'm currently reading feel like a chore to update, and somewhat redundant given my lack of consistency in updating it.</p>
