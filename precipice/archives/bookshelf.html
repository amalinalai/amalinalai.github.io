	<h2>aka <mark>... the bookshelf lol</mark></h2>
	
	<p>The bookshelf, as its name might lead one to deduce, was a place for me to keep track of books I want to read, am reading, and have read. However, these lists became somewhat outdated and obsolete, as I have a list written on a physical whiteboard by my bed. Consequently, the function of this page has shifted to house a collection of books that I really enjoyed and have left an impression on me!</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — 2023</h3>
	<p><a href="/compost/bookshelf-v1">link to its archived version.</a></p>
	<p>The layout was heavily inspired by Nico Chilla's are.na channel, <a href="https://www.are.na/nico-chilla/website-as-a-collection-of-boxes"><i>website as a collection of boxes</i></a> which houses links to different websites whose layout consists of rectangles, often arranged in some ordered, grid-like fashion. Moreover, I'd chosen to write the contents of the webpage in Malay, a language I'd spent half my life studying in school but still struggling to understand and use. This choice to use a non-English language was inspired by <a href="http://tiana.land/">Tiana Dueck's page</a> written in Dutch and her motivation behind it. I hope to someday become better at Malay, and I have every intention of writing more of my pages in Malay.</p>
	
	<p>My own rendition was simply four square boxes stacked in two rows and two columns to form another, larger square. I'd achieved this using the <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code> property on the outer container <code>div</code>. In the event where the screen size got too small, the square boxes would reorganize themselves into a single column. I had a lot of help from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">css-tricks' guide to flexbox</a> while figuring out flexboxes.</p>

	<p>Within my to-read list, I'd tried to make the list look like stacked books with a few <code>inline div</code> elements. Although it works, I think I could find a way to execute this better.</p>

	<h3>version 1.5 › 2023 — 2024</h3>
	<p>When 2023 came around, I didn't know how to include both my 2022 and 2023 lists of books I've read without it being overwhelming, long and hard to scroll through in such a tiny box. I ended up simply removing the books I've read section. A part of me really wants to re-do this entire page; I rarely update my webpages and so the part of what books I'm currently reading feel like a chore to update, and somewhat redundant given my lack of consistency in updating it.</p>
	
	
	<h3>version 2.0 › july 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>As metnioned, updating what I was currently reading often was too much of a hassle, and so the library was often left outdated and honestly, decrepit-feeling. Because of that, I decided to transform its function — instead of being a space to chronicle all the books I read, wanted to read and was currently reading, which worked against how I maintained this website (sparsely, and only during periods of inspiration or high creativity), I decided to instead chronicle books I really liked or enjoyed reading.</p>
	<p>Personally, I always feel shy sharing my opinions of works of art so publicly. Knowledge of what I love would now be exposed to the world, and left at the mercy of dissidents or critics who hate the work, and I'd be left feeling unjustified in my enjoyment of something. But I've been working on overcoming these fears, and this interpretation of my bookshelf is a manifestation of that! Taste, after all, is subjective, and difference in opinion is something I should fear less.</p>

	<p>Still inspired by grids, I wanted the boxes to be able to expand when clicking on it to reveal my own review of it. I used my favourite <code>details</code> tag for each book review!! (It's amazing how many things you can achieve with the <code>details</code> tag, honestly.) I also made use of the CSS <code>grid</code> layout to achieve flexibility of the squares to changing square and screen sizes. Drawings are my own and done in procreate.</p>
