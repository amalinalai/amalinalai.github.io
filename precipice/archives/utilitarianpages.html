	<h2>aka <mark>"""boring""" pages</mark></h2>
	
	<p>If you've rooted around long enough you may have noticed a few pages are rather boring looking. Specifically, the Sunday Sites index page, the 32-bit cafe submissions index page, my sitemap and my kobo "hacks" page. I call these my utilitarian pages, because they have minimal styling (just enough to make it accessible) and are often just a somewhat plain HTML page with the default colours.</p>
	
	<p>For the first three of those pages, I see them more as transitory spaces — their main purpose is to serve as an organized repository of pages, and primarily the goal is to bring you to some other pages rather than to have you stay on them for too long. Thus, I didn't see any particular need to have them be anything more than that. They serve their purpose well in their simple dressing.</p>
	
	<p>For my kobo "hacks" page, I think I've always been drawn to professor's old webpages that are in Times New Roman on a white background, that focused more on the content and less on how the web page looks. There's something quite charming to me about it. I thought my kobo "hacks" would fit that look, seeing as it serves as a page to collect these little tools and knick-knacks for my kobo, not quite unlike a webpage that might be educating me on some physics phenomena.</p>
