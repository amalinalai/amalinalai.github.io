	<p>Inspired by <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/shrines/tatu/">sadgrl's t.A.T.u. shrine</a>, I wanted to make a shrine for the music group that has had the greatest impact on me: Oh My Girl.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › september 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>I started building this web page with accessibility in mind, so I opted to design the layout with <code>flexbox</code>. The neat thing about flexboxes is that you can change the order and direction of how elements within it wrap, allowing for quick and good looking responsive design. In this case, I could have two columns of content on desktop which would collapse into a single column on mobile devices easily.</p>

	<p>A happy coincidence was that I could set <code>position:sticky;</code> on the navigation section in the sidebar! This meant that I could have the navigation easily accessible even with the huge amounts of text I was going to have on the page.</p>
	<p>Theme-wise, I associate Oh My Girl with the forest and fairies, likely because my first encounter with them was their music video for <i>Closer</i>, which had a very similar aesthetic and visuals. Consequently, I picked a nice stock photo of a forest and extracted a colour palette from the image for this shrine.</p>

	<p>I also knew that I wanted this page to be text-focused, so I opted to go with the default Arial / sans-serif font because it's easy on the eyes, especially as a digital reading medium! Writing for the shrine itself was pretty easy; I knocked out the entire thing in about a day or two. As I wrote, I kept finding more things I wanted to say and add — though I wish I had gone in with a bit more clarity on the messaging or main points I wanted to convey. Nevertheless, I think the almost haphazard, frantic quality of my writing is a genuine expression of how I feel and how it felt attempting to pen down all the thoughts I have about this group. Rather than some thinkpiece with a main message, I guess this shrine is exactly as its name suggests: simply an ode to this group that has given my life a lot of purpose and value in ways I never expected.</p>
