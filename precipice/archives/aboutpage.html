	<h2>aka <mark>the page i yap about myself</mark></h2>
	
	<p>I never had a separate "about" page because I thought my professional page covered that aspect, and in my head it seemed weird to have two about pages. <i>However,</i> I caved because I kept seeing all these really cute and personal "about me" pages, and I wanted one too. (I especially wanted a place for those 88x31 buttons!)</p>
	<p>It may seem kind of weird that it took me this long to create a cozier version of an about page, but I guess I had never seen myself participating much in the personal-web community beyond doing my own thing. This changed as I started to learn more about webrings and cliques, and I wanted to dip my toes in it... In the end, a professional biography is a lot more corporate and business-like, while this separate page would allow me to express myself more freely!</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › aug 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>I knew I wanted something soft, pink and frilly for my personal about page. From the beginning, I had in mind the particular lace border I ended up using in my design from Lovecandied, a now-defuct Japanese web sozai (web material) page I used to trawl as a kid. It didn't matter that the website was in Japanese — somehow my ten-year-old self figured it out. However, the website has been dead for awhile at this point, and I had to heavily rely on the Wayback Machine to find what I wanted! It's kind of sad visiting the site via the Wayback Machine; because although it's preserved a lot of the website across multiple years, there are many broken image tags, meaning tons of beautiful pixel art I admired have been lost to time.</p>

	<figcaption><span>Version 1.0 of my 'about me' page</span>. The side-frill details were done using the border-image property of the div, which was a first for me! I also made use of an external bitmap font to tie in the whole pixel art look of the page. The design makes me giddy with happiness. Screenshot taken 9 August 2024.</figcaption>

	<p>It still boggles my mind that centering a <code>div</code> is as easy as <code>margin; auto;</code>. I don't remember that being a feature when I was still on Blogger coding templates; my memories of trying to center elements involved tables...? I may be wrong, but anyway I digress.</p>
	
	<p>This template is a simple <code>div</code> centered horizontally with the aforementioned code. I also used the <code>border-image</code> property for the first time, and it was really much simpler than I expected! <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-image/">CSS-tricks provides a comprehensive guide</a> on this property which helped make using it painless. It's interesting to see how far CSS has come — when trawling the old web, like Lovecandied, creating elements with image borders typically used images within tables. It's nice that it's no longer necessary to do that, and can all be done with CSS.</p>
	
	<p>I made use of a few other resources from different web sozai resources within the page. For icons I couldn't find anything appropriate for, I made my own pixel icons.</p>
