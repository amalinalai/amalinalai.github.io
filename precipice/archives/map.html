	<h1><span class="sketch-highlight">map of the internet</span></h1>
	<h2>aka <mark>charting my way on these digital seas</mark></h2>
	
	<p>As elaborated on the page itself, the map of the internet was created following <a href="http://tiana.land/map/1/">Tiana Dueck's guide</a>. There are many ways to think of it, sometimes I think of it as an anchor. It's almost like a bookmarks page, linking to places on the internet I want to revisit again, but more curated, placed in a way that aligns with what I want my web experience to be like. I'd like to someday re-do the map again, and reorganize, prune, and add links in a way that works for me today.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — ???</h3>
	<p>Part of my inspiration for this was Chinese painting scrolls and how the act of unscrolling and moving downwards through the scroll acts like the passage of time, or telling a tale. I also thought about how it would parallel the top-down scroll of a web page. In Tiana Dueck's guide, she mentions deciding our hierarchy of places on the map and visualising that in terms of proximity; mapping the path we'd like to take across the internet from our source / home. I place my source, or home, at the top of the page, and slowly work downwards as I get further.</p>

	<p>At the same time when I was creating this page, I was also very much interested in 1-bit pixel art (still am, at the time of writing this in December 2023), thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BJGpixel">Brandon James Greer's videos</a>. I decided to try my hand at it, in an isometric perspective. The process took a couple of days, but I'm still immensely proud of how it looks like, given that it's my first attempt at 1-bit pixel art.</p>

	<p>As with some of my other layouts, this one was again made using <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template. Most of the responsive aspect of the design was came naturally by just allowing the elements to resize to pages on their own. The only issues was handling the hitboxes for links on the map image itself, which I found the solution for on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53597608">stackoverflow here</a> (bless) and used in conjuction with a <a href="https://zaneray.com/responsive-image-map/">responsive image map generator</a>.</p>
