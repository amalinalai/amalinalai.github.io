	<h1><span class="sketch-highlight">404 page</span></h1>
	<h2>aka <mark>the fever dream pages</mark></h2>
	
	<p>Typically, the 404 page on most websites are rather boring: they tend to display the error code, tell you the page is not found and link back to the main website. Occassionally, they might include a cute image of their mascot holding up some kind of 404 sign. However, in January 2023 I chanced upon <a href="https://5amgirlfriend.neocities.org/notfound/house404">5amgirlfriend's 404 page</a> which chronicles the day of "maid-chan", the purported housemaid of 5amgirlfriend. I adored it, its warmth and how it turned the 404 page from something purely perfunctory to something <i>more</i>. So tickled by this idea, I wanted something <i>more</i> for my 404 page as well.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › mid 2023 — ???</h3>
	<p>In some ways, the 404 page is a liminal space — a transitory place between the "wrong" or non-existent page, and the "right" page. I wanted to lean heavily into that and underscore its liminality; rather than being a page one typically quickly navigates away from, I wanted to draw out the duration of time one spent in this space. I settled on a (very short) text-based adventure, as those websites I also often associated with liminal spaces with how barebones they often looked. It was also a good opportunity to write a short "story" — something I enjoyed doing.</p>
	
	<p>The short adventure itself involves the concepts of warped time; a space in which time doesn't move and instead is still for as long as you wanted to remain in it. In some ways, I was drawn to the idea of respite, of pausing time as a way to get a breather from everything else. Perhaps it's a reflection of my psyche at the time of writing: a yearning to have a space just like that to settle for a little while, a refuge from the stressors of life. It's called the fever dream pages because of this — reading and writing it makes me feel like I'm in one.</p>
	
	<p>Originally I intended for the short adventure to be something longer, with more winding paths and branches to follow, but I was coding and writing it at a point in time where I didn't feel like I had too much time to spare. I thus settled on the current length, though I am not opposed to extending it in the future.</p>
	
	<p>The layout itself is simple, and I made use of <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template.  I also made use of the <code>details</code> element to allow visitors to decide what to do by clicking on the <code>summary</code>, and have the adventure respond to their choices by displaying the details on-click.</p>
