	<h1><span class="sketch-highlight">404 page</span></h1>
	<h2>aka <mark>the fever dream pages</mark></h2>
	
	<p>Typically, the 404 page on most websites are rather boring: they tend to display the error code, tell you the page is not found and link back to the main website. Occassionally, they might include a cute image of their mascot holding up some kind of 404 sign. However, in January 2023 I chanced upon <a href="https://5amgirlfriend.neocities.org/notfound/house404">5amgirlfriend's 404 page</a> which outlines the day of "maid-chan", the purported housemaid of 5amgirlfriend. I adored it, its warmth, and how it morphed the 404 page from something purely perfunctory to something <i>more</i>. It gave the 404 page personality, and its something I still think about from time to time. So tickled by this idea, I wanted something <i>more</i> for my 404 page as well.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › may 2023 — ???</h3>
	<p>In some ways, the 404 page is a liminal space — a transitory place between the "wrong" or non-existent page you've found yourself on, and the "right" page its trying to steer you towards. I wanted to lean heavily into that and underscore its liminality; rather than being a page one typically quickly navigates away from, I wanted to draw out the duration of time one spent in this space, should one choose to do so. I settled on a (very short) text-based adventure, in part, because the bareboned nature of text-based websites often reminded me of liminal spaces as well. I also enjoyed writing, weaving words in a way that hopefully elicits emotions and draws out visceral, physiological sensations.</p>
	
	<p>The short adventure itself involves the concepts of warped time; a space in which time doesn't move and instead is still for as long as you wanted to remain in it. Like sitting in a park without a clock, listening to the ducks and watching the stillness of the trees. In some ways, I was drawn to the idea of respite, of pausing time as a way to get a breather from everything else. Perhaps it's a reflection of my psyche at the time of writing: a yearning to have a space just like that to settle for a little while, a refuge from the stressors of life. It's called the fever dream pages because of this — writing and reading it made and makes me feel like I'm in one, free from the tethers of reality.</p>

	<p>As it stands, the 404 page, or rather pages, consists of four separate HTML files. Originally I intended for the short adventure to be something longer, with more winding paths and branches to follow, but I was coding and writing it at a point in time where I didn't feel like I had too much time to spare. I thus settled on the current length, though I am not opposed to extending it in the future.</p>
	
	<p>The layout itself is simple to not draw attention away from the contents of the writing, and I made use of <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template.  I also made use of the <code>details</code> element to allow visitors to decide what to do by clicking on the <code>summary</code>, and have the adventure respond to their choices by displaying the details on-click. At any point in time, the reader can choose to leave by clicking on the "Turn back and head home" link.</p>
