	<h2>aka <mark>in my intellectual era</mark></h2>
	
	<p>I chanced upon the <a href="https://bookbug.neocities.org/">Bookbug club</a>, which is a monthly online book club for personal websites. I've always loved reading, but I've never actually been part of a book club before! I did participate in a "book club" with some online friends before, but it only lasted for one book, and I was so nervous about the whole thing. There's something quite daunting about sharing and writing my opinions on books I've read, as I've noted in my <a href="/precipice/bookshelf">bookshelf page</a>, but I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone. I thought it'd also be fun to not only try to be more critical in my reading, but to also translate those thoughts into a piece of cohesive writing.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › september 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>I opted for a really simple design (that somehow still took a lot of time fixing) using <code>flexbox</code>. Honestly, I almost gave up with the flexbox and thought of using CSS grids instead, but I persevered and made it work! I wanted to make each review look a bit like index cards you'd pull out from a filing cabinet, thus the black rounded tabs with the corresponding book month. In a way, because of the chronological and structured nature of book reading in the book club, I thought this was a cute way to design the page. The <code>transform: rotate();</code> property honestly gave me such a difficult time, but I had it figured out in the end after realizing you could choose the pivot about which you rotated the divs.</p>
	
	<p>The adorable worm was drawn by maple and can be obtained from the bookbug website! I thought it was a lovely illustration that I simply had to use, and the link colours of the page were taken from this illustration. Because the worm reminded me of having a nice picnic and reading under the tree, I chose a green plaid background that's reminiscent of picnic mats.</p>

	<p>Because I used flexboxes, the responsive design came along really easily. I just had to <code>unset</code> the rotation transformations on some of the divs and change how some of the elements <code>flex-wrap</code>, but at this point I've had quite a bit of practice with the latter after all the pages I've coded for this website that it was not difficult.</p>
