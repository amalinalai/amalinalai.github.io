	<h2>aka <mark>living my childhood dreams hehe</mark></h2>
	
	<p>Growing up on the internet, I remember pixel adoptables being a thing — they were pixel art characters or objects made by other people that you could "adopt" by uploading it to your own webpage and linking back to the original artist. Often times, these adoptables would be put together on a specific page on a person's website known as the "toybox". I never had pixel adoptables on my own page until now. In a way, it's like allowing myself the chance to live a part of my childhood that I didn't get to. Moreover, as many of these pages I grew up with start to disappear because of the loss of these communities due to centralized social media platforms, and just everyone generally growing up and getting older, I wanted somewhere safe to keep these parts of my childhood I look back fondly upon.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — ???</h3>
	<p>Clearly, I was inspired by Tamagotchis, another aspect of my childhood I look back fondly upon. My Tamagotchi was secondhand, but I'd treasured it dearly, and still have it today. I settled on making pixel art since these adoptables were often in pixel art as well. I think one can tell from my uneven edges that I'm nowhere near an expert at pixel art; again this is one of my first few early attempts at this new medium and I have a lot to learn! But it came out okay.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>You could navigate by clicking on the Tamagotchi buttons, or via linked texts within the "screen" of the Tamagotchi. As a callback to how I remember many of these websites used to achieve their navigation, I made use of an <code>iframe</code> for the "screen" of the Tamagotchi, which would change when navigating to different adoptable categories.</p>
	
	<p>This one was again made using <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template, and the responsive design for this page was achieved using the same solutions as the one I used for version 1.0 of my map of the internet:</p>
