	<h2>aka <mark>living my childhood dreams hehe</mark></h2>
	
	<p>Growing up on the internet, I remember pixel adoptables being a thing — they were pixel art characters or objects made by other people that you could "adopt" by uploading it to your own webpage and linking back to the original artist. Often times, these adoptables would be put together on a specific page on a person's website known as the "toybox". I never had pixel adoptables on my own page until now. In a way, it's like allowing myself the chance to live a part of my childhood that I didn't get to. Moreover, as many of these pages I grew up with start to disappear because of the loss of these communities due to centralized social media platforms, and just everyone generally growing up and getting older, I wanted somewhere safe to keep these parts of my childhood I look back fondly upon.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › 2022 — 2024</h3>
	<p><a href="https://amalinalai.github.io/compost/bookshelf-v1">link to its archived version.</a></p>
	
	<p>Clearly, I was inspired by Tamagotchis, another aspect of my childhood I look back fondly upon. My Tamagotchi was secondhand, but I'd treasured it dearly, and still have it today. I settled on making pixel art since these adoptables were often in pixel art as well. I think one can tell from my uneven edges that I'm nowhere near an expert at pixel art; again this is one of my first few early attempts at this new medium and I have a lot to learn! But it came out okay.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>You could navigate by clicking on the Tamagotchi buttons, or via linked texts within the "screen" of the Tamagotchi. As a callback to how I remember many of these websites used to achieve their navigation, I made use of an <code>iframe</code> for the "screen" of the Tamagotchi, which would change when navigating to different adoptable categories.</p>
	
	<p>This one was again made using <a href="https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/">1-Line Layouts</a>' <i>Clamping My Style</i> template, and the responsive design for this page was achieved using the same solutions as the one I used for version 1.0 of my map of the internet:</p>
	<ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53597608">stackoverflow here</a>, and</li>
	<li><a href="https://zaneray.com/responsive-image-map/">responsive image map generator</a></li></ul>
	
	
	<h3>version 2.0 › august 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>I wanted to change up the toybox to be something a bit more accessible: the pastel colours were hard to read, and the space to view the pixels were a tad too small on mobile! Morever, I wanted to add more subpages and the Tamagotchi pixel art couldn't serve that purpose for me anymore.</p>
	
	<figure>
	<img src="images/toybox-v2.jpg" alt="A screenshot of my toybox page.">
	<figcaption><span>Version 2.0 of my toybox</span>, with a modern and simple design. Screenshot taken 16 August 2024.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>I had a few ideas initially (e.g. a pixel art toybox, keys for links, flexbox to have a resposive design where the navigation can move, a collage lace doily for a background) but I finally settled for something much simpler. The layout would be easy to implement and make responsive, but also match the new non-pixel adoptables that I wanted to add. Although this meant I would lose a bit of the touch of nostalgia from the old design, I actually think it reminds me of Gaiaonline profile pages when I was younger? So maybe it didn't lose that many nostalgia points.</p>
	
	<p>I used the same 1-Line Layout and actually didn't overhaul too much of the skeleton HTML. Most of the changes happened CSS-wise.</p>
