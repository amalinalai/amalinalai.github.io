	<h2>aka <mark>showing off my skillzz (?)</mark></h2>
	
	<p>I saw <a href="https://hell-mouth.neocities.org/sewing">Lillith (Hellmouth)'s sewing page</a> and was immediately enamoured and inspired! How cool is her craft?! Having just completed my first major sewing project only months prior, I thought it would be a fun way to retrospectively blog about my experience and proudly show off the labour of my intense work.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › august 2024 — ???</h3>
	<p>Because most of my web pages are light and modern, I wanted to try something a bit darker, with some more vintage influences! I initally thought of doing a newspaper-like design, but settled on something a bit simpler to execute! This design had me fiddling and learning about <code>background-image</code> and <code>background-size</code> to get it just right. I used one of these <a href="https://thegraphicsfairy.com/vintage-creamy-ephemera-labels/">vintage ephemera labels from The Graphics Fairy</a> and modified it by (1) adding a <a href="https://thegraphicsfairy.com/vintage-clip-art-antique-sewing-machine-table/">vintage sewing graphic</a> (2) making the side borders line it nicely so it could tile (almost) perfectly for any length of text.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>I also used and modified another vintage label for the sidebar navigation (desktop) that links to the different sewing project pages. The navigation itself is an <code>iframe</code> that I can easily modify and add to as I add sewing projects. The design with a fixed sidebar reminds me so much of the Tumblr website layouts I grew up with. For mobile users, I decided to shift the sidebar navigation to the top of the page, since there would be a "back to top" button to help jump to the navigation when necessary.</p>

	<p>Since the pages would be image-heavy, I decided to compress the images by dithering them. I still wanted to keep the colours, so I didn't do a monochrome dither, and instead tried to keep within a 32-colour palette, or less where possible.</p>
