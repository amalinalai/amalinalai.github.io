	<h2>aka <mark>this page!!!!</mark></h2>
	
	<p>Yes, hi, hello. As I mentioned in my prelude, this page is for me to not only document how this website changes across time, but also keep a record of the things I was inspired by and how I achieved certain aspects of my layouts on this webpage. I am not an expert coder, so much of it typically involves a lot of stackoverflow, web searching and reading guides.</p>
	
	<h3>version 1.0 › december 2023 — ???</h3>
	<p>I took heavy inspiration from <a href="https://handmade-web.net/resources.html">Handmade Web's menu</a> on mobile (the rotated menu text, and clicking to open), as well as <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">100r.co</a>'s use of the <code>details</code> tag to implement their navigation. I wanted to combine this two, and see how I could implement a sideways navigation using the <code>details</code> tag. It took some fiddling, learning how the <code>rotate</code> and <code>transform-origin</code> properties work so I could rotate the navigation button (that's actually the <code>summary</code> tag) how I wanted.</p>
	<figure>
	<img src="images/archives-v1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the archives page. On the left, there is a narrow strip of neon green with the rotated words 'click for navigation'. To its right, there is a column with neon green buttons on a white background, linking to the various pages of the archives. To the right of that is the main article with black text on white background. Some header texts have been additionally styled with the same neon green accent colours.">

	<p>Overall, I took my main page code as a base code to building this page. The responsive design of this page was a little more involved, as it required me to reset the rotation of the <code>summary</code> tag. I also didn't want the navigation pane to pop up by the side anymore, since it would take up valuable space on the screen for mobile devices, so I coded it to appear above the main text using the <code>z-index</code> property.</p>

A narrow green bar with the words 'click for navigation' is now located at the top of page, and below it is a white rectangle that obscures the black text on white background beneath it. Within it, there are green buttons neon green buttons linking to the various pages of the archives.">

	<p>The choice of <code>Chartreuse</code> as a colour was frankly arbitrary; I'd initially wanted yellow but didn't quite like how it looked with the highlighting I used for the headers, so I went to look at the default list of CSS defined colours and picked this one! Though I almost went with a blue or pink instead. On the note of highlighted text, I took the sketch highlight code I used for the main header from <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-highlight-text/">a blog post on alvarotrigo</a> on how to highlight text with CSS (see example 7).</p>
