  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome to lina's toybox, home to adoptables from the old web (and new)!
  While these were common in websites I visited when I was younger, I've never had one of my own until now.
  I've tried to salvage the older pixels from archive.org to give them a new home here! Clicking on the pixel should link back to where they're from. All these external links open in a new tab.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, none of the adoptables have alt-text descriptions, I'm sorry! I will get to them when I can.</p>

  <div class="warning">Do note that there will be image heavy (small pixels and gifs) pages!<br><br>You may navigate using the links above.</div>
  
  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <p>Only last 3 updates are kept.</p>
  <ul>
	<li>2024/08/29: New character adoptable. New kitty friends clique.</li>
	<li>2024/08/21: New special adoptable.</li>
	<li>2024/08/15: New layout. New pixels in characters, misc and special. New category for cliques.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Thanks</h1>
