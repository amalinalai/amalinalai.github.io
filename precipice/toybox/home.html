  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my toybox, home to pixel adopts/adoptables from the old web (and new)!
  While these were common in websites I visited when I was younger, I've never had one of my own until now.
  I've tried to salvage the older pixels from archive.org to give them a new home here! Clicking on the pixel should link back to where they're from. All these external links open in a new tab.</p>
  
  <p>You may navigate using the buttons below, or if there are accessibility issues, the adoptables are sorted in the following categories:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="char.html" title="characters and animals" target="frame">Characters and animals</a> <img src="up2-1.gif"></li>
  <li><a href="edibles.html" title="edibles" target="frame">Edibles</a> <img src="up2-1.gif"></li>
  <li><a href="misc.html" title="misc" target="frame">Miscellenous/Others</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p style="color: #fda9a9; text-align: center;">Do note that there will be image heavy (small pixels and gifs) pages!</b></p>
