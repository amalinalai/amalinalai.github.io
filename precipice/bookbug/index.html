	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>The Collector</em> presents us with two intertwined perspective: that of Frederic Clegg, a young clerk, and Miranda Grey, an art student whom Fred doesn&#39;t know personally but grows obsessive over ‚Äî to the extent that he kidnaps her and keeps her in his basement.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this book! It was a page turner for me, and I was rather impressed by how distinct the two voices read in the novel.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, I felt a bit of sympathy for Fred, the captor, while reading his perspective initially. Fowles&#39; writing was compelling to me in that manner; much like Miranda, I found myself thinking &quot;he isn&#39;t <em>the worst</em>&quot; because he seemed to maintain some measure of decorum and promise to respect Miranda. Yes, he did kidnap her, but I could not help but feel a little bit of hope that perhaps he might change his mind (thinking &quot;it&#39;s not too late yet&quot;) and not go any further with this. Something along the lines of, &quot;perhaps he&#39;s not evil or unredeemable, perhaps he just wanted to approach her but didn&#39;t know how, and took it to an extreme.&quot;</p>
<p>I think this is what makes the ending much more powerful for me. That hope that still lingers, contrasted with the horrifying metamorphosis through the book where he starts to enjoy the power he has over his &quot;guest(s)&quot; until we reach the conclusion.</p>
<p>I was also pleasantly surprised we got the perspective of Miranda. I did enjoy reading her chapters quite a bit, especially insight into her life before she was kidnapped. I wonder what can be said about her relationship with G.P. and the power dynamic between the two of them. How would that be compared to say, that of Fred and her, for example?</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p>For how much Clarice Lispector is raved about, I really wanted to love this. Yes, she writes beautifully, and there are some lines that I really admired, but I found that they were often few and far between much larger swathes of repetitive texts that carry little to no weight or meaning. Often times, I would read a line and go, "this sounds lovely, but why did you write this?"</p>
	<p>I don't think she explores anything particularly new thematically in this either; in fact the idea of the limitations of words and the inability to fully encapsulate an experience in words was something we also saw in <em>The Apple in the Dark</em> (published in 1961, about 12 years before this ‚Äî see Mar 2025's review for my thoughts on that). Moreover, in <em>√Ågua Viva</em> I can't be the only one who felt like she was saying the same thing over and over, just with different words, right? I would read a paragraph having appreciated a point she made, and then the next few pages would be going over the same points over and over again, with no radical or novel additions to what she'd already established.</p>
	<p>Overall my gripes with this are very similar to that for <em>The Apple in The Dark</em>. I think I can safely say Lispector's works are just not for me! Perhaps some people would enjoy the vibes of flowing with a string of consciousness. I would've liked something sharper, wittier, and more concise, I think.</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont</em> starts with Mrs. Palfrey moving into the Claremont Hotel after her husband passes. Here, she meets other elderly folk like her, and the story explores the cadence of the residents&#39; lives at the hotel.</p>
	<p>Mrs. Palfrey expects her grandson, whom she dotes on quite a bit, to visit her as he&#39;s working nearby at the British Museum, but is disappointed and embarrassed when he fails to do so. She then meets Ludo, an aspiring writer, who takes an interest in Mrs. Palfrey as inspiration for his novel, and both of them conspire to have Ludo pretend to be her grandson instead.</p>
	<p>Despite its namesake, the book actually does lightly touch on the other inner lives and feelings of the residents at the hotel as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>I think there&#39;s something quite charming about the book, in its own way. The writing is quaint, rather sharp and funny at times, and we get a little bit of insight into every one of our cast of characters. I do agree that the book is a little &quot;boring&quot; in that nothing particularly huge happens; there is no big conflict that spans the entirety of the book. Moreover, the potential for Ludo&#39;s real identity to come out doesn&#39;t feel all that weighty in the end. It never feels like more than a tiny shadow of afterthought, and I guess I was expecting it to have a much bigger role in the story.</p>
	<p>In fact, this book didn&#39;t go the way I expected it to ‚Äî I thought the book would explore and develop the relationship between Mrs Palfrey and Ludo a little more. But that&#39;s okay!</p>
	<p>I suppose the real heart of the book is an exploration of the complexities of aging, which is something that really resonates with me and what I&#39;ve been thinking of recently. E.g., The loss of your physical abilities, and at some point, your autonomy, which can feel rather scary and disheartening. </p>
	<p>But the biggest ones are of course, loneliness and filial piety. At the age where you&#39;ve lost partners, most of your friends, etc, and new friendships that come and go due to circumstance and death, I think it&#39;s natural that one turns to and thinks of their own children and grandchildren, hoping that they would spend some of their time with you.</p>
	<p>Wanting someone to depend on and lean on when I&#39;m old is something I&#39;ve thought a lot about recently. Growing up Asian, the concept of filial piety and an expectation that children will look after their parents when the latter is older is a core part of our value system. But I don&#39;t think wanting someone to look after you is something that is a valid reason for children. As someone who doesn&#39;t want to have children, a lonely future is something I&#39;m very afraid of.</p>
	<p>Also, I think the book, all things considered, still ended on a rather sweet and happy note. Because when I think of loneliness in the elderly today, with stuff like AI, love scams etc., I feel like the reality is so much more dreary. I wonder how this book but set in today&#39;s world would&#39;ve panned out.</p>

	<p>Just wanted to put something up quick up, so a short list of my thoughts for now. Perhaps I&#39;ll come back to this to write a proper, thoughtful review.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Was really excited to read it again, after many years</li>
	<li>I&#39;ve always enjoyed the ragged charm of the story. It&#39;s in part a love story that doesn&#39;t necessarily inspire aspiration / sweet feelings, but there&#39;s a very visceral and raw feeling to it</li>
	<li>Some very powerful confessions of love and declarations from Catherine and Heathcliff!!</li>
	<li>I love that I sometimes hate the characters, and that they&#39;re not perfect and so very human</li>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>The Post-Office Girl</em> tells the story of Christine, a woman who works as a post-office clerk in Austria after World War 1. One day, she receives a letter from her estranged aunt and uncle from America to visit them while they are on a trip in Switzerland. Although initially reluctant, Christine&#39;s mother urges her to go. </p>
	<p>I finished reading this in a day ‚Äî it&#39;s probably one of my new favourite books! The prose reads so well and so beautifully; each sentence vividly paints the scene and captures the heart of the characters&#39; feelings so well that they become my own. This book is sad, dark, desperate and yet, so magnetic. I find it interesting that the original German title which (according to Wikipedia) roughly translates to &quot;The Intoxication of Transformation&quot;, hints at the trajectory of the novel, while the English title does not. </p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>Christine feels out of place as soon as she arrives; in contrast to the bourgeoisie living at the hotel in Switzerland, her clothes are worn and outdated, and she sticks out like a sore thumb. Her rich aunt, who had managed to escape Austria decades before, and thus the impoverished fate of her own sister and relatives, takes it upon herself to transform Christine. Christine is awestruck at everything she&#39;s never experienced before, drawing the attention of everyone else in the hotel. She feels like a different person, and even adopts a different name. Her joy, however, is cut short when her poor origins are revealed, and she is ultimately sent back to her hometown. Now, intoxicated by the glimmer of what <em>could be</em> but what she can no longer attain, Christine finds everything she does have in her Austrian town hateful and disgusting, which is very much reminiscent of the allegory of Plato&#39;s cave.</p>
	<blockquote>In this instant, shaken to her very depths, this ecstatic human being has a first inkling that the soul is made of stuff so mysteriously elastic that a single event can make it big enough to contain the infinite.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Once shame touches your being at any point, even the most distant nerve is implicated, whether you know it or not; any fleeting encounter or random thought will rake up the anguish and add to it. This first blow marks the end of Christine‚Äôs unselfconsciousness.</blockquote>
	<p>Throughout this, the writing does a fantastic job at contrasting the two worlds, and giving us a glimpse into the world from Christine&#39;s perspective. It does well at drawing out our own empathy; we feel indignant for how she&#39;d been wronged by people at the hotel, we witness how the rest world loses its shine just as she does, and we understand the twisting pain at having to return to her old life after experiencing luxury.</p>
	<p>(Tangentially, the progression of the novel up to this point reminds of <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>.)</p>
	<blockquote> All she knows is that something has been taken from her, that now she must leave that blissfully winged self to become a blind grub crawling on the ground; knows only that something is gone forever.</blockquote>
	<p>The novel takes an even darker twist in the second part after when Christine meets Ferdinand, an old friend of her brother-in-law. In him, she finds a kindred soul, and despite the joy and respite they find in each other for awhile, their poverty sours this relationship, which leads them to make some life-changing decisions.</p>
	<p>I didn&#39;t expect the ending (or even the entire second part) of this book at all, and even was even more surprised at how it ended on somewhat of a cliffhanger. It makes sense now that I&#39;ve learnt that the book was never completed and was published posthumously. However, I liked where it ended off, with us not knowing exactly how their plans panned out.</p>
	<p>Perhaps I can&#39;t put well into words just yet how much I really enjoyed this book ‚Äî it&#39;s something that I&#39;m going to recommend to everyone. His writing truly touched the core of my heart in all the right ways and resonated with me. And I am so excited to pick up a different book by Zweig!</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</em> is a character study into a fictionalized version of the Kinkaku-ji arson by a novice monk. The novel follows Mizoguchi, a stutterer who becomes an acolyte at the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, and how he ultimately comes to commit the act.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>I guess the book has a few main themes: beauty vs ugliness, good vs evil, inner vs outer world. For me, the latter was the theme I found most interesting out of all of them, perhaps in part because this idea of a divide between one&#39;s inner world and the outer world where we connect with people is something that I&#39;ve been thinking about lately. Mizoguchi constantly feels as though his inner world is disconnected from the outer world. At the beginning, he finds that his stuttering prevents him from expressing himself freely and distracts others from what he actually means to say and convey.</p>
	<blockquote>This first sound is like a key to the door that separates my inner world from the world outside, and I have never known that key to turn smoothly in its lock. Most people, thanks to their easy command of words, can keep this door between the inner world and the outer world wide open, so that the air passes freely between the two; but for me this has been quite impossible. Thick rust has gathered on the key.</blockquote>
	<p>Later throughout the book, it seems that the Golden Pavilion becomes another source of this frustration, preventing him from reaching out into this outer world. The Golden Pavilion, since his youth, has been the epitome of beauty in the eye of his mind; it is an unattainable perfection that he constantly mulls over and obsesses, to the extent that it stops Mizoguchi from experiencing the world and this outer life he feels so cut off from. It is this palpable isolation and exasperation that&#39;s accumulated for years of his life that ultimately leads Mizoguchi to burn down the Golden Temple, if only as a means to free himself.</p>
	<blockquote>‚ÄòWhy does the Golden Temple try to protect me? Why does it try to separate me from life without my asking it? Of course it may be that the temple is saving me from falling into hell. But by so doing, the Golden Temple is making me even more evil than those people who actually do fall into hell, it is making me into ‚Äúthe man who knows more about hell than anyone‚Äù.‚Äô</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Then in a tone that was almost like a curse I addressed the Golden Temple roughly for the first time in my life: ‚ÄòOne day I shall surely rule you. Yes, one day I shall bring you under my sway, so that never again will you be able to get in my way.‚Äô</blockquote>
	<p>This is my first Yukio Mishima book, and I think I don&#39;t have any particularly strong feelings about it. It was a book that read well, and I didn&#39;t find it a chore to keep reading. It seems to be a common opinion that the writing feels misogynistic a lot of times, and this is probably one of the biggest gripes I had with it. Nevertheless, I think I&#39;d still be curious to read his other works.</p>
	<blockquote>The sweetness was faintly reflected on my tongue from within the thin steel, from within the unattainable essence of the steel. The clarity of form, the luster of iron like the indigo color of the deep sea ‚Äì it was they that carried this limpid sweetness which coiled itself securely round the tip of my tongue together with my saliva. Finally the sweetness receded from me.</blockquote>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>The Apple In The Dark</em> first follows Martim, who&#39;s on the run after committing a crime. He stumbles upon a farm and its owner, Vitoria, where he finds work. We&#39;re also introduced to Ermelinda, who lives on the farm and begins to fall in love with Martim. Through the book, we switch perspectives between the three, listening in on their inner thoughts and struggles to understand, untangle and communicate with each other. </p>
	<p>This is my first Clarice Lispector book, so I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what to expect out of it. I&#39;ve read that she considers this her magnus opus, and I believe one of her longer works. Some reviewers have noted that one shouldn&#39;t start with this as their first Lispector book, but alas, here we are after the fact.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>In a sense, nothing really happens in the book; the plot is wafer thin and we are instead carried along meandering, run-along thoughts. We are quite literally plunged right into their psyches, almost as though you&#39;re reading their feelings and hysteria unfold in a stream of consciousness. Lispector also writes heavily self-referential metaphors that aren&#39;t always comprehensible, making it often difficult to follow (one will note with a glance at Goodreads that this difficulty in understanding the entire text is a common sentiment). While initially frustrating as I trudged through the first two thirds of the book, as I went into the last third, I wondered if this was intentional? The biggest question/theme that I got from the book (or at least the last third) was whether  we can ever fully express our internal world to anyone else. Can we ever express ourselves fully and help someone else understand it? Should we? Or do we need to? And similarly, the obscurity of many of the metaphors in the characters&#39; internal thoughts felt like a physical representation of this struggle to &quot;translate&quot; our inner world.</p>

	<blockquote>If we understand it profoundly, do we also need to understand it superficially? If we recognize in its slow moving our own shaping‚Äîthe way you recognize a place where you‚Äôve been at least once‚Äîdo you have to translate it into words that compromise us?</blockquote>
	
	<p>However, with this piece sitting at around 500 pages, I think the book feels worse off for it. I wrote in my notes that &#39;this feels like an unpolished fever dream, and not in a good way&#39;. I also felt like the book only really picked up in the last third, and I was actually so drawn into the last conversation between Vitoria and Martim. So I think I would have enjoyed it a lot better if this book had only been about ~ 100-200 pages. Instead, it often felt like a chore getting through this book, especially with metaphors that either weren&#39;t clear or felt lazy in writing, which made it quite a disappointing read. I&#39;ve pulled some quotes that had me eye rolling:</p>
	
	<blockquote>That nevertheless was that thing that only died because the man died.</blockquote>
	<p><em>You start to notice that Lispector uses "thing" a lot, in place of some other noun. This just made the writing vague and obfuscated.</em></p>
	<blockquote>Because, in a perfect movement, the world had become once more whole and even had its old mystery‚Äîexcept this time, before the enigma closed, Ermelinda had placed herself inside it, as enigmatic as the enigma.</blockquote>
	<p><em>I don't know, "as enigmatic as the enigma" just felt... lazy?</em></p>
	<blockquote>It was cold and yet she was asphyxiated, with her heart swollen in her chest, maybe because not a single drop had yet fallen.</blockquote>
	<p><em>I don't see why it can't be cold and for her to feel asphyxiated at the same time. Why the choice of "yet"?</em></p>
	
	<p>I will note here that I&#39;m not sure if my reading experience would have been better if I&#39;d been able to read it in Portugese. I&#39;m often left wondering whether it was something lost in translation that made it so hard for me to fully appreciate it. Also as a side note, while reading, I was actually reminded of <a href="https://www.are.na/block/24519919">this seminar</a> by Ocean Vuong on metaphors.</p>
	<p>I don&#39;t want to be overly harsh; there were some lovely prose that I appreciated. And perhaps books like these just aren&#39;t for me! I&#39;d probably give another (much shorter) Lispector work a shot. But I don&#39;t think I would have finished this if it weren&#39;t for the book club.</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>Despair</em> opens with our protagonist, Hermann, encountering Felix, whom he claims is his perfect lookalike. Written in first person, we see how Hermann latches on to this resemblance in an almost obsessive behaviour, and over the course of his book, enacts a plan whose basis lies in their resemblances.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>Hermann insists upon their resemblances with such excessive force that I come to accept and believe it ‚Äî it is as though no other truth can exist. I think that is what is so fun about books with unreliable narrators: what other truth can you glean from the writing? Early in the book, there were already seeds to how much we can trust our dear narrator.</p>
	<blockquote>
	I could, of course, have crossed it out, but I purposely leave it there as a sample of one of my essential traits: my light-hearted, inspired lying.
	</blockquote>
	Also, perhaps Hermann&#39;s sheer obsession over how alike they were, his insistence and constantly reminding us of it, should&#39;ve sent our alarm bells ringing. But I think there was something rather magnetic about the writing that made it easy to believe him. It was funny, playful, and sometimes very self-aware.
	<blockquote>
	And a damned good fool I have made of someone. Who is he? Gentle reader, look at yourself in the mirror, as you seem to like mirrors so much.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	Do you feel the tang of this epilogue? I have concocted it according to a classic recipe. Something is told about every character in the book to wind up the tale; and in doing so, the dribble of their existence is made to remain correctly, though summarily, in keeping with what has been previously shown of their respective ways; also, a facetious note is admitted‚Äîpoking sly fun at life‚Äôs conservativeness.
	</blockquote>
	<p>The book starts off meandering at the beginning, and I wonder if on second read, it would feel less like a blind stumbling about and a way to seed more clues as to the unreliability of Hermann? It really only picks up towards the later part of the book where Hermann sets his supposedly-ingenious insurance fraud scheme into motion, at which point I was fully hooked and voraciously reading to finish the book.</p>
	<p>All in all, I did enjoy it! Also something to note: Nabokov translated this book himself, which I would think must be both an immense pressure, but also immense pleasure to be able to maintain the vision of one&#39;s book in a different language.</p>
	<p>Also, wonder what people think of the cover? Despair lies in the gap between the reflection?</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>Invisible Cities</em> is a short novel consisting of short chapters describing fictitious cities. Written in 1972, it takes the perspective of Marco Polo describing these cities to Kublai Khan. Interspersed between these chapters on the cities, we find snippets of the conversations and interactions between the two characters, sometimes with varying styles of presentation, e.g. as though written like a play in one, and as normal prose in others.</p>
	<p>I typically prefer approaching any sort of media (books, movies) mostly blind, i.e. not looking it up on the internet, reading its Wikipedia or checking its ratings on Goodreads/Letterboxd, mainly because I want to approach whatever it is with an open mind. However, I think that somewhat failed for me with this book: in my first read, I got to about 47% without particularly enjoying it ‚Äî the prose was pretty, but I wasn&#39;t processing much of it and the cities blurred into each other, making the reading process a bit more boring and arduous.</p>
	<p>It was only after reading that &quot;many of [the prose poems of the cities] can be read as commentary&quot; on Wikipedia that I realized I should&#39;ve probably involved more Critical Thinking as I read, so I restarted reading, this time equipped to take notes and reflect between each chapter.</p>
	<p>I feel like the book is best consumed in short bursts ‚Äî letting each city sit with you for a bit. My second read went on a bit quicker and a little more enjoyable, and I felt like because I was forcing myself to slow down and reflect, I would re-read lines when my mind would wander, and I would try to make sense of descriptions and let my mind subconsciously make associations and draw connections to other things. (As a side note ‚Äî seeing Rene Magritte&#39;s painting, <em>The Castle of Pyrenees</em>, as the cover for the book on Wikipedia feels kind of aptly connected to the way I&#39;ve re-read this book; Magritte was a Surrealist, a movement that sought to paint and write from the subconscious. So it felt a bit like trying to probe my subconscious by letting myself steep in thought after each city.)</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!!</strong></p>
	<p>Nevertheless, my feelings on this book are still mixed. Undoubtedly the writing is pretty. Cities are dreamlike, whimsical and sometimes subverts your expectations.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	Here remains the half-Sophronia of the shooting-galleries and the carousels, the shout suspended from the cart of the headlong roller coaster, and it begins to count the months, the days it must wait before the caravan returns and a complete life can begin again.
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>However, I just felt like sometimes the book was never really anything much more? In my opinion, it is lacking as &quot;commentary&quot; because it never really says anything‚Ä¶ or anything that is particularly interesting. Each city chapter is only about 1 to 3 pages, which leaves plenty wanting for a substantial argument. Instead, it felt more like quips or motherhood statements about society and the world, or hints at some bigger or larger idea without expounding on them‚Ä¶ leaving me asking &quot;so what?&quot; (Or if I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;d love someone to enlighten me on this. Maybe I&#39;m just bad at reading subtext.) To me, it would be more aptly put that some cities reflect some aspect of society, rather than provides commentary on it.</p>
	<p>Moreover, nothing actually happens (like literally, there is no plot), and so the drive to keep reading has to be mostly personal and internal. However, if not for the book club, I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve finished this ‚Äî with no unique insights, and with me being largely apathetic towards Marco Polo and Kublai Khan or why these conversations between them were happening, the 150-odd pages did feel rather long by the end.</p>
	<p>At the end of it though, I think its mathematical structure is testament to this piece of work being more experimental and pushing the boundaries of literature and the novel. It genuinely had some lovely, and rich descriptions that painted pictures of each city in my mind. But honestly, writing these a few days after finishing, none of them really stuck with me. I think some people would really love and enjoy this book, but it&#39;s not for me.</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p>The Death of Ivan Ilyich is a novella that details the life, and subsequently, slow, agonizing death of its namesake, a high-court judge in Russia.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>We are painted the picture of Ivan, who goes through life amicably, going through the motions of living and working towards developing his career and improving his social status, but who doesn&#39;t seem to have a strong passion or opinion on one thing or another. In some ways, he lives through life as <em>expected</em> of him, rather than because of his own convictions. For example when he chooses to marry, it&#39;s not because he was deeply in love with his wife, but because it appeared to be the &quot;right&quot; thing to do in that it was beneficial, and would be looked favourably upon by other people. This of course pans out badly, as the relationship sours and he begins to hate her for how uncaring and nonchalant she is towards his declining health.</p>
	<p>What I thought was interesting is that we get a glimpse of some sort of passion that borders on obsession for decorating his new home to the point that he&#39;s thinking about it during work and sometimes exerting himself to execute it according to his vision, but it ultimately becomes the very point in life that changes the course of his life downhill.</p>
	<p>I doubt we are to look favourably upon this "passion": the narrator doesn&#39;t fail to point out that Ivan&#39;s interior decoration is trite and mediocre, a transparent attempt to appear more upper class that ends up looking gauche. The way I see it, it&#39;s a passion that isn&#39;t a passion for the love of the activity, but one that is still born from concern of social status, appearances and earthly indulgences. And because of that, I think, it still fails in giving Ivan a &quot;good life&quot;, ultimately becoming the final nail in the coffin.</p>
	<blockquote>Ivan Ilyich‚Äôs chief pleasure was giving little dinners to which he invited men and women of good social position, and just as his drawing room resembled all other drawing rooms so did his enjoyable little parties resemble all other such parties.</blockquote>
	<p>I think it&#39;s interesting that Tolstoy chose to open with Ivan&#39;s funeral, reflecting some of the inner thoughts of the people who surrounded him in his life (sans Gerasim). His death doesn&#39;t seem to particularly faze them; much like Ivan, they seem to be going through the motions of life, much more concerned with what his death would mean for them, such as a promotion or coming into some money, rather than a reflection of Ivan&#39;s life or their own mortality. And it is only as I read along that I felt like the story tied itself quite neatly in a loop: as Ivan comes to the realization that his life was a farce towards the end of the book, I was thinking back to the first few chapters and how the other characters would still be lacking in compassion even after his death, just as they were when he was in his deathbed. It had me wondering if it is only through some similar sickness that they would realize what a &quot;good life&quot; truly is.</p>
	
	<blockquote>So on receiving the news of Ivan Ilyich‚Äôs death the first thought of each of the gentlemen in that private room was of the changes and promotions it might occasion among themselves or their acquaintances.<br></blockquote>
	
	<p>Also, the idea of selfishness seems to be a big part of the story, and perhaps the irony is that up until the final chapter, Ivan is still, in a way, selfish. He demands compassion and pity from his family, hating them when they don&#39;t offer it. When Gerasim extends compassion, Ivan imposes on him by making requests for him to stay, help him hold up his legs through the night, making Gerasim forgo some sleep, etc. And it is only in the end, he lets go of this selfishness by understanding that it is in his death (i.e. letting go of his life, as he had been holding on to desperately) that he can release his family of torment and pain, (even if we objectively feel that they weren&#39;t the best caretakers for him!) thereby acting selflessly and with compassion. </p>
	<blockquote>Always and forever the same, always these endless days and nights. If only it would come quicker! If only what would come quicker? Death, darkness?‚Ä¶No, no! Anything rather than death!</blockquote>
	<blockquote>And suddenly it grew clear to him that what had been oppressing him and would not leave his was all dropping away at once from two sides, from ten sides, and from all sides. He was sorry for them, he must act so as not to hurt them: release them and free himself from these sufferings. ‚ÄúHow it was revealed to him that though his life had not been what it should have been, this could still be rectified. He asked himself, ‚ÄúWhat is the right thing?‚Äù <br><br>
	‚ÄúYes, I am making them wretched,‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúThey are sorry, but it will be better for them when I die.‚Äù</blockquote>
	<p>All in all, I think this was interesting and not what I expected! I liked that it was a short read but makes you reflect a little on your own life and mortality. Also, I couldn&#39;t find any information on who translated my version of the book.</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>The Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas</em> opens with Br√°s Cubas already dead and writing from the grave, recounting his life story. Through the novel we get a glimpse of who he was, as well as his attempts at romances and political ambitions.</p>
	<p>I was rather nervous going into the book since it would be a translated text. It&#39;s perhaps a silly thing, but a couple of less than ideal experiences with translated fiction has led me to worry that the writing would read flat, and the depth and richness of the original writing would be lost in the sieve of translation. However, I was pleasantly surprised ‚Äî the version I had immediately engaged me from the start with its charming prose and wit that read easily.</p>
	<p>And the footnotes! To preface, I read my books on my Kobo e-reader, so footnotes and endnotes are identical in terms of how they are laid out. Not to digress too much from the content of the book, I have such a love-hate relationship with footnotes and endnotes. While reading, I really appreciated the ability to have context and references that I would&#39;ve otherwise not caught on to or understood, but I&#39;ve always felt like they disrupt the flow of reading for me.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>For the most part, I enjoyed the writing ‚Äî it was witty and funny, and at points sharp. Chapters are often short, sometimes breaking our conceptions of what a chapter or story should be, particularly as Machado de Assis often breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the reader, rather than write as some kind of omnipotent narrator.  The narrator, Br√°s Cubas, is often meandering, sometimes saying nothing at all with his observations and reflections. I do adore the writing style (though how much of it I should attribute to Machado de Assis or Thomson-DeVeux, the translator, I do not know!).</p>
	<blockquote>
	One afternoon, after a few weeks of gestation, the edifice of my paternal fantasies was reduced to rubble.
	</blockquote>
	<p>In a matter tangentially related to footnotes, something I didn&#39;t always enjoy was the multitude of references to other literary works, often used as analogies. Perhaps someone more well-read than me would disagree; but often I found the footnotes and endnotes doing much of the heavy lifting to explain and make sense of them, which to me disrupted the reading experience. A magnanimous reading would offer that it reflected the well-read nature of our narrator, but to me it often felt superfluous and a bit like name dropping that left me feeling more frustration than reverence.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, I think on the outset, the concept of <em>The Posthumous Memoirs</em> being a retrospective from a dead person is delightful. And as I read on, I think it further defies the expectations of a story in not just its format, as mentioned earlier, but its contents.</p>
	<p>For me, my biggest takeaway from the book was the idea of mediocrity. Throughout the book, after reading failure after failure, I was sometimes left wondering: why should I bother reading about his life? Br√°s Cubas was, in many ways, a &quot;failure&quot; (to use the word loosely), having never succeeded in romance, nor political ambition, nor his final project, the Br√°s Cubas plaster. Endeavours find an anticlimactic end, seemingly antithetical to our own expectations that a novel would tell of some epic story, journey or adventure. Neither was Br√°s Cubas a shining beacon of character, a person to emulate or follow, often leaving me feeling conflicted with the way he acts.</p>
	<blockquote>
	I didn‚Äôt attain fame with my plaster, I wasn‚Äôt a minister, I was no caliph, and I never knew marriage. It is true that, alongside these lacks, I was granted the good fortune of not having to earn my bread with the sweat of my brow.
	</blockquote>
	<p>And I think these things, in his moral and practical failings, in his mediocrity, makes Br√°s Cubas a lot more human, and the story a lot more comforting. It&#39;s not a celebration of mediocrity ‚Äî in fact, I believe Br√°s Cubas sees it as a tragedy, where he says at last &quot;I had no children; I did not bequeath to any creature the legacy of our misery.&quot;. But I think it forces us to confront that at the end of it all, sometimes mediocrity and failure is all we can achieve. And the book is a testament that being mediocre doesn&#39;t make our life any less rich.</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>A Pale View of Hills</em> is written from the perspective of Etsuko, a widow living in England, whose first daughter, Keiko, had committed suicide. Etsuko reflects on her past when she was living in Nagasaki post-World War 2 with her then-husband and while pregnant with Keiko. She recounts her friendship with a single mother, Sachiko, and her daughter, Mariko who lived nearby. Through the story we learn that Sachiko had been trying to take a resistant Mariko along with her and an American soldier, Frank (whom Mariko despises) to America, a story that parallels how Etsuko had arrived in England with Keiko and her new husband, an Englishman.</p>
	<p>I think Ishiguro has such an interesting writing texture. In a way, the book can feel "flat" in its writing: direct, straightforward and easy to digest, but there's a sense that there's a lot more brimming beneath the surface. In particular, dialogues in the book fascinated me quite a bit. I found it interesting the way characters often spoke around each other, repeated themselves or responded in indirect ways with seemingly unrelated responses. In a way, it was both jarring and realistic ‚Äî jarring because it's an atypical way of writing, and realistic because daily conversations can often sound like that too, albeit maybe to a lesser extreme. There is a lot left unsaid, but found nestled in the layers and spaces between words, and this is something that is mirrored in the overall writing as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>The book has a very chilling and ominous quality to it as well, a result of the way he weaves words. To me, reading it felt like there was always some kind of tension, a persistent anticipation of what sort of horrors or ghosts one might find reading on. There is a sort of creeping dread that comes with reading the book sometimes. In particular, I'm constantly reminded of the scene towards the end of the book where Mariko repeatedly asks Etsuko why she has a rope as she approaches; the tension was so palpable reading it that I myself was fearful for Mariko's safety as her questions went unanswered.</p>
	<blockquote>
	‚ÄúWhy are you holding that?‚Äù she asked.<br>
	‚ÄúThis? It just caught around my sandal, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù<br>
	‚ÄúWhy are you holding it?‚Äù <br><br>
	[...] The child began to run, her footsteps drumming along the wooden boards. She stopped at the end of the bridge and stood watching me suspiciously. I smiled at her and picked up the lantern. The child began once more to run.
	</blockquote>
	<p>It becomes obvious that Etsuko and Sachiko are unreliable narrators as conversations and imagery repeats itself through the book (e.g. the story Sachiko tells Etsuko about the woman in the river that Mariko saw, and later, Sachiko herself in the river with the kittens). Etsuko herself later admits this at some point in the book: ‚ÄúMemory, I realize, can be an unreliable thing; often it is  heavily coloured by the circumstances in which one remembers, and no  doubt this applies to certain of the recollections I have gathered  here.‚Äù</p>
	<p>And of course, the ending scene where the pronouns are switched really brings this to the fore. The ending is rather open ended, but my initial reading was that Sachiko and Mariko are Etsuko and Keiko, at least in the sense that their stories were the experiences of Etsuko and Keiko, with small details altered.</p>
	<p>I think perhaps Sachiko's interactions with Etsuko (and by extension, dissociating from the memories by viewing it as a third person) through the book could be seen as Etsuko now reflecting on and negotiating her feelings towards her actions and its consequences. Namely, what is probably some guilt (and maybe shame?) towards Keiko's suicide, which I see as reflected in the scene where Etsuko holds a rope as she approaches Mariko (Keiko) to placate and convince her to move to America (England), an imagery that implies some responsibility for Keiko's death. To this end, I think distinctly of the way Sachiko would ask Etsuko why the latter wasn't asking her any questions about Frank, or the way in which Sachiko would tell Etsuko that she would come to understand certain things when she became a mother: to me, it felt like there is a hint of desperation in Sachiko (Etsuko) to try to justify and/or find validation for her choices within herself.</p>
	<blockquote>
	‚ÄúYou know how it is with children,‚Äù said Sachiko. ‚ÄúThey play at make-believe and they get confused where their fantasies begin and end.‚Äù<br>
	‚ÄúYes, I suppose it‚Äôs nothing unusual really.‚Äù
	</blockquote>
	<p>Along those lines, I think Etsuko in the memories could also be thought of as Etsuko's regrets and/or what she might have done differently (Sachiko therefore being a reflection of her choices) e.g. caring for the child, looking for Mariko at night etc.</p>
	<p>However, I think something that maybe doesn't fit quite well in this interpretation is how Frank is painted as someone who is unreliable (constantly spending Sachiko's money, bailing on the plans to take her and Mariko to America) and if, or whether, that is reflective of what happened between Etsuko and her English husband. We don't get much of a glimpse into the latter's personality (at least I didn't on my first read), so I'm curious how it ties in on that front.</p>
	<p>All in all this was a book I completely devoured! I would love to give this another read again, perhaps with a greater emphasis on understanding the role of Jiro's father in the story.</p>
