	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>The Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas</em> opens with Br√°s Cubas already dead and writing from the grave, recounting his life story. Through the novel we get a glimpse of who he was, as well as his attempts at romances and political ambitions.</p>
<p>I was rather nervous going into the book since it would be a translated text. It&#39;s perhaps a silly thing, but a couple of less than ideal experiences with translated fiction has led me to worry that the writing would read flat, and the depth and richness of the original writing would be lost in the sieve of translation. However, I was pleasantly surprised ‚Äî the version I had immediately engaged me from the start with its charming prose and wit that read easily.</p>
<p>And the footnotes! To preface, I read my books on my Kobo e-reader, so footnotes and endnotes are identical in terms of how they are laid out. Not to digress too much from the content of the book, I have such a love-hate relationship with footnotes and endnotes. While reading, I really appreciated the ability to have context and references that I would&#39;ve otherwise not caught on to or understood, but I&#39;ve always felt like they disrupt the flow of reading for me.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, I enjoyed the writing ‚Äî it was witty and funny, and at points sharp. Chapters are often short, sometimes breaking our conceptions of what a chapter or story should be, particularly as Machado de Assis often breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the reader, rather than write as some kind of omnipotent narrator.  The narrator, Br√°s Cubas, is often meandering, sometimes saying nothing at all with his observations and reflections. I do adore the writing style (though how much of it I should attribute to Machado de Assis or Thomson-DeVeux, the translator, I do not know!).</p>
<blockquote>
One afternoon, after a few weeks of gestation, the edifice of my paternal fantasies was reduced to rubble.
</blockquote>
<p>In a matter tangentially related to footnotes, something I didn&#39;t always enjoy was the multitude of references to other literary works, often used as analogies. Perhaps someone more well-read than me would disagree; but often I found the footnotes and endnotes doing much of the heavy lifting to explain and make sense of them, which to me disrupted the reading experience. A magnanimous reading would offer that it reflected the well-read nature of our narrator, but to me it often felt superfluous and a bit like name dropping that left me feeling more frustration than reverence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think on the outset, the concept of <em>The Posthumous Memoirs</em> being a retrospective from a dead person is delightful. And as I read on, I think it further defies the expectations of a story in not just its format, as mentioned earlier, but its contents.</p>
<p>For me, my biggest takeaway from the book was the idea of mediocrity. Throughout the book, after reading failure after failure, I was sometimes left wondering: why should I bother reading about his life? Br√°s Cubas was, in many ways, a &quot;failure&quot; (to use the word loosely), having never succeeded in romance, nor political ambition, nor his final project, the Br√°s Cubas plaster. Endeavours find an anticlimactic end, seemingly antithetical to our own expectations that a novel would tell of some epic story, journey or adventure. Neither was Br√°s Cubas a shining beacon of character, a person to emulate or follow, often leaving me feeling conflicted with the way he acts.</p>
<blockquote>
I didn‚Äôt attain fame with my plaster, I wasn‚Äôt a minister, I was no caliph, and I never knew marriage. It is true that, alongside these lacks, I was granted the good fortune of not having to earn my bread with the sweat of my brow.
</blockquote>
<p>And I think these things, in his moral and practical failings, in his mediocrity, makes Br√°s Cubas a lot more human, and the story a lot more comforting. It&#39;s not a celebration of mediocrity ‚Äî in fact, I believe Br√°s Cubas sees it as a tragedy, where he says at last &quot;I had no children; I did not bequeath to any creature the legacy of our misery.&quot;. But I think it forces us to confront that at the end of it all, sometimes mediocrity and failure is all we can achieve. And the book is a testament that being mediocre doesn&#39;t make our life any less rich.</p>

	<h2>my thoughts...</h2>
	<p><em>A Pale View of Hills</em> is written from the perspective of Etsuko, a widow living in England, whose first daughter, Keiko, had committed suicide. Etsuko reflects on her past when she was living in Nagasaki post-World War 2 with her then-husband and while pregnant with Keiko. She recounts her friendship with a single mother, Sachiko, and her daughter, Mariko who lived nearby. Through the story we learn that Sachiko had been trying to take a resistant Mariko along with her and an American soldier, Frank (whom Mariko despises) to America, a story that parallels how Etsuko had arrived in England with Keiko and her new husband, an Englishman.</p>
	<p>I think Ishiguro has such an interesting writing texture. In a way, the book can feel "flat" in its writing: direct, straightforward and easy to digest, but there's a sense that there's a lot more brimming beneath the surface. In particular, dialogues in the book fascinated me quite a bit. I found it interesting the way characters often spoke around each other, repeated themselves or responded in indirect ways with seemingly unrelated responses. In a way, it was both jarring and realistic ‚Äî jarring because it's an atypical way of writing, and realistic because daily conversations can often sound like that too, albeit maybe to a lesser extreme. There is a lot left unsaid, but found nestled in the layers and spaces between words, and this is something that is mirrored in the overall writing as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Spoilers henceforth!</strong></p>
	<p>The book has a very chilling and ominous quality to it as well, a result of the way he weaves words. To me, reading it felt like there was always some kind of tension, a persistent anticipation of what sort of horrors or ghosts one might find reading on. There is a sort of creeping dread that comes with reading the book sometimes. In particular, I'm constantly reminded of the scene towards the end of the book where Mariko repeatedly asks Etsuko why she has a rope as she approaches; the tension was so palpable reading it that I myself was fearful for Mariko's safety as her questions went unanswered.</p>
	<blockquote>
	‚ÄúWhy are you holding that?‚Äù she asked.<br>
	‚ÄúThis? It just caught around my sandal, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù<br>
	‚ÄúWhy are you holding it?‚Äù <br><br>
	[...] The child began to run, her footsteps drumming along the wooden boards. She stopped at the end of the bridge and stood watching me suspiciously. I smiled at her and picked up the lantern. The child began once more to run.
	</blockquote>
	<p>It becomes obvious that Etsuko and Sachiko are unreliable narrators as conversations and imagery repeats itself through the book (e.g. the story Sachiko tells Etsuko about the woman in the river that Mariko saw, and later, Sachiko herself in the river with the kittens). Etsuko herself later admits this at some point in the book: ‚ÄúMemory, I realize, can be an unreliable thing; often it is  heavily coloured by the circumstances in which one remembers, and no  doubt this applies to certain of the recollections I have gathered  here.‚Äù</p>
	<p>And of course, the ending scene where the pronouns are switched really brings this to the fore. The ending is rather open ended, but my initial reading was that Sachiko and Mariko are Etsuko and Keiko, at least in the sense that their stories were the experiences of Etsuko and Keiko, with small details altered.</p>
	<p>I think perhaps Sachiko's interactions with Etsuko (and by extension, dissociating from the memories by viewing it as a third person) through the book could be seen as Etsuko now reflecting on and negotiating her feelings towards her actions and its consequences. Namely, what is probably some guilt (and maybe shame?) towards Keiko's suicide, which I see as reflected in the scene where Etsuko holds a rope as she approaches Mariko (Keiko) to placate and convince her to move to America (England), an imagery that implies some responsibility for Keiko's death. To this end, I think distinctly of the way Sachiko would ask Etsuko why the latter wasn't asking her any questions about Frank, or the way in which Sachiko would tell Etsuko that she would come to understand certain things when she became a mother: to me, it felt like there is a hint of desperation in Sachiko (Etsuko) to try to justify and/or find validation for her choices within herself.</p>
	<blockquote>
	‚ÄúYou know how it is with children,‚Äù said Sachiko. ‚ÄúThey play at make-believe and they get confused where their fantasies begin and end.‚Äù<br>
	‚ÄúYes, I suppose it‚Äôs nothing unusual really.‚Äù
	</blockquote>
	<p>Along those lines, I think Etsuko in the memories could also be thought of as Etsuko's regrets and/or what she might have done differently (Sachiko therefore being a reflection of her choices) e.g. caring for the child, looking for Mariko at night etc.</p>
	<p>However, I think something that maybe doesn't fit quite well in this interpretation is how Frank is painted as someone who is unreliable (constantly spending Sachiko's money, bailing on the plans to take her and Mariko to America) and if, or whether, that is reflective of what happened between Etsuko and her English husband. We don't get much of a glimpse into the latter's personality (at least I didn't on my first read), so I'm curious how it ties in on that front.</p>
	<p>All in all this was a book I completely devoured! I would love to give this another read again, perhaps with a greater emphasis on understanding the role of Jiro's father in the story.</p>
