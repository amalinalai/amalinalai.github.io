		<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n some ways, I like to think of this skirt as a family heirloom. I can't take credit for most of the skirt: my mum had handed me the this blue sarong almost complete, all sewn with its pleats, side and bottom hems, as well as waistband. The only thing missing was to close up the skirt and add some closures to make it a functional piece. She had, when she was around my age (in her 20s), sewn this and another red skirt at a sewing class I think, and she'd somehow kept it for over 40 years before passing it to me. The skirt was actually with me for awhile, and it wasn't until 2019 when I finally decided to finish up the skirt.</p>

		<p>I added a hook closure as well as a zipper by hand. Then, I closed up the skirt about midway down, allowing a side slit for more mobility when walking. I love the feel of the fabric and I think my mum chose a really gorgeous fabric. It's not quite an A-line skirt, but it's not quite a straight skirt either because of the pleats at the top! Either way, I really like how it falls on me. It's one of my favourite skirts to this day, and I get a lot of compliments for it! I like to tell people the story of how it was made by my mum, and finished by me, many years later. :)</p>
