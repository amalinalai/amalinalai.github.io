		<p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen NIKI <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nikizefanya/p/DFMOLozv-UA/">shared a dresscode</a> for her concert that I was going to, I knew I wanted to <em>not</em> buy a one-time use outfit. I was hoping I could find something in my wardrobe, but the theme of "going under" (ethereal siren, mermaids etc) was tough for me because I don't generally gravitate towards light or blue coloured clothing. I did a bit of research on pinterest for outfit ideas, and I gathered that something satin, teal or blue and with a lot of ruffles would work.</p>

		<p>I was originally thinking of wearing the <a href="blue-sarong.html" target="_top">blue sarong skirt</a> (I changed the skirt choice in the end), but didn't have a top that fit the description. Honestly, my clothing tends to be quite practical; most of my tops are tees because that's just what's most comfortable and easy for me. I tend to avoid ruffles and pleats because they're difficult to iron. I'm slowly trying to avoid purchasing anything polyester — and that included new fabrics.</p>
		
		<p>But I remembered that I had a (likely polyester) satin fabric that I'd originally tried to make into a petticoat for my <a href="robe-alanglaise.html" target="_top">robe a l'anglaise</a> project, but ultimately scrapped because the material was too sheer and I didn't have enough of it to make a decent lining. I thought it would be the perfect way to re-use and rework the fabric by making a sheer outerwear that felt ocean-adjacent!</p>

		<figcaption>Quick pattern!</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span> drafted a simple pattern for the body based on a denim jacket I own that comes up to just below my bust. Because that denim jacket was made out of jeans, the shapes involved were mostly rectangular and easy to draft. I knew I wanted something somwhat ruffle-y in a way that is reminiscent of seafoam, so I decided to add some ruffles to the bottom (which was also just rectangular pieces I joined together — I had to do this since the material wasn't long enough to go the whole way through).And despite the easy task of cutting rectangles, I had an annoying time cutting the satin fabric (it tended to slip and shift under my scissors), so I think I'll invest in a rotary cutter in the future.</p>

		<p>I didn't take many pictures of the process because it was mostly just sewing straight lines. For the ruffles, I did a straight stitch by hand across the top of the fabric so I could gather the fabric, then just eyeballed the ruffles so they were roughly even. I used a couple of pins to align the halfway and quarter marks of the ruffles panel to the body panels just to guide me in that process.</p>
		
		
		<p>For the bell sleeves, I mostly winged it. The sleeves were made up of two parts. For each sleeve, I first cut a rectangle that was folded in half and sewn into a cylinder that connected to the main body pieces. This came down to around elbow length and gave the sleeves a straight cut. The second part of each sleeve was made by cutting an extra long rectangle. Then, I folded it in half sewed a diagonal line from the bottom to the top of the short edge, such that I got a trapezoid shape. The shorter edge was connected to the sleeve, thereby giving a billow-y, bell-shaped sleeve. For the closure, I just attached two pieces of ribbon that I could tie in the front. I also put together a quick necklace from air dry clay which I wore at the concert!</p>

		<p>Unlike my previous projects, this had a lot more spontaneous "winging it". For example, I didn't take any measurements for the sleeve pieces, and just used the sewn piece to estimate how long I needed to make each piece. It was actually kind of scary but also liberating to not obsess over having things be perfect! I think it helped that I didn't really have a pattern to follow, and was kind of drafting my own.</p>
		
		<p>I actually still want to finish off some of the raw edges and seams; I didn't quite manage to finish it before the concert! Alas it probably won't get done until I want to wear this top again LOL.</p>
