		<p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen my partner asked me if I wanted to be wearing historically accurate garments to watch Hamilton: I immediately said yes. I'd been a long time fan of watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bernadettebanner">Bernadette Banner</a>, and had a vague interest in historical fashion, so it seemed almost like a dream come true to have an excuse to wear something worlds apart from modern fashion.</p>

		<p>Although we'd initially thought of purchasing these garments, I couldn't wholly justify the prices if we were going to primarily just wear it for one night, so I volunteered to sew us our clothes. Frankly, the prospects were both exhilarating and terrifying — this would be my first major sewing project. I'd done simple mending, small hand sewing projects, and even a little embroidery, but I'd only attempted one other time to sew an actual garment from scratch, and that didn't turn out well. Neither was I particularly skilled or comfortable with the sewing machine, but what's that if not space for growth? So thus began my two-month long journey of pricked fingers, aching backs and frenzied sewing.</p>
		
		<hr>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">H</span>aving no experience with drafting my own patterns, much less historical ones, I bought all my patterns from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/black_snail_patterns">Blacksnail Patterns on Etsy</a>. Hamilton takes place from around 1770s to 1800s. I ended up choosing the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/711259300/robe-a-la-anglaise-1770-90-incl-two">robe a l'Anglaise</a> over the a la Française, mainly for practical reasons, but the latter seemed to show up more over the former in the musical's costuming. The robe a l'Anglaise comes in two parts: an outer gown consisting of the bodice and a skirt for the back-half, as well as a separate petticoat (inner skirt) piece that was sometimes made of the same fabric pattern.</p>

		<p>My partner got me some plastic boning and plain maroon cotton fabric on 50% discount, (which was such a steal!) while I worked on assembling and cutting the pattern out. I belated realized that the pattern was made to be worn with a corset, which I:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>didn't have,</li>
		<li>didn't want to buy, and </li>
		<li>didn't trust myself to make.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Nervous, I did a very basic mock-up for the bodice from some spare fabric I had laying around, and made pattern adjustments from the mock up. Then, it was time to start on the actual thing.</p>

		<p>The historically accurate version of the dress would've been all handsewn, which is what the entire pattern is written for, but with enough contemplation, I managed to take some workload off and work on about half of the bodice segment by machine. I also had to put boning into some of the lining pieces. There was supposed to be boning in the front but I skipped it because I didn't have enough boning, though if I could go back, I probably would have added them in so the fronts look much more structured and smoother. I had to handsew the front and back pieces together, and I was actually quite impressed with how neat my straight stitches could be by hand! Though not perfect, I was pretty proud of myself.</p>

		<figcaption>The lining piece of the bodice. Despite making a mock-up, I somehow still had to make alterations to it due to a gaping back.</figcaption>

		<p>Despite my best efforts, I still had to make quite a few alterations on the back panel in the end — it was slightly too wide at the top back, and the front bust and there was some gaping. (Shoutout to my mum for helping me pin the excess fabrics so I knew how much to cut off.) Because the bodice is constructed in panels,  having to take off extra fabric from the back meant I could trim it from along the seams, and none would be the wiser from appearances. The front darts, however, were probably out of the ordinary, but I don't think it looked too out of place in the end.</p>

		<p>Having done the bodice, it was time for the sleeves. I shortened the pattern for my arm length, then cut and sewed them on mostly with machine. The tops of the sleeves come together with the bodice armholes via some pleats, which I eyeballed (despite the pattern providing actual positions for the pleats that I completely didn't notice lol). I wish there was a bit more mobility on the arms, but I suppose it's not like I was going to do Olympic weightlifting or gymnastics in the robe.</p>

Historically, straight pins would've been used to keep the bodice closed in front.<br><br> There are darts above the front bust area because there was some gaping there as well. I'm not sure they're very historically accurate, but they didn't feel too out of place. Here, you can also see the missing front boning.</figcaption>

		<p>The skirt… was a hellish process. Pleats, so beautiful, yet so painful. I had to measure and mark the small pleats out, then pin everything in place, then handsew in a basting stitch to keep everything in place. I think I took about half a day working on the pleats, mainly because I had to redo it twice. But I think it was worth it all in the end, pleats are so beautiful and I have newfound respect for garment makers who did / do fold their pleats by hand.</p>

		<p>Finally, it was the assembly of the skirt to the bodice! I had left the inner lining and outer bodice pieces unsewn at the bottom edge, so the skirt piece could be nicely tucked into it. I then handsewed everything in place, and I'm ashamed to say this part wasn't my best work!!! The curve in the bodice, the thickness of the fabric, and trying to ensure that the skirt lined up correctly so I could have pockets in my petticoat made it all difficult to have neat stitches on either sides, but as long as it looks good on the outside I had to accept it haha.</p>

		</figure>

		<p>I also had to make a bum roll: these were worn under the petticoat to give an illusion of a certain figure (big ass!), and though I initially intended not to make one, I realized that the robe looked strange and sat weirdly on my body without the bum roll? I think the sheer weight of the skirt made the whole dress sit flatly on my butt, so the bum roll helped hold it up a bit more to give it some shape! Moreover, I think these details actually add to the feeling that it came out of the correct century, and so I sewed it out of scrap fabric and stuffed it with all the small fabric scraps I saved from the project.</p>

		<p>The petticoat was actually done in a bit of a rush (thus the lack of photos) — I was going overseas for 2 weeks before returning to watch the musical, and was trying to finish as much as I could before my flight. Although the original pattern provided a pattern for a petticoat with separate pockets, I actually ended up vaguely following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK_t5eqGPd4&pp=ygUdcGV0dGljb2F0IHdpdGggc3F1YXJlIHBvY2tldHM%3D">this video</a> for a petticoat-inspired skirt with built-in pockets. It was simple and only required rectangular pieces of fabric which was easy to cut, and therefore rather easy to assemble.</p>

		<p>The fabric which I picked out and which my partner had bought for me a few weeks after buying the main fabric for the gown, by a stroke of miraculous happenstance matched the colour of the main gown so perfectly and was floral, like I wanted! I'm very happy with the fabric choice, and I can see myself wearing the petticoat as a regular skirt in my day-to-day. My only regret was that I was a bit afraid to cut off the excess fabric at the bottom, and this resulted in a slightly too long petticoat, and a weird hem that didn't sit properly! It's on my to-do list to fix the hem of the petticoat.</p>

		<hr>
		
		<p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>nd finally! The main dress was complete. On the day of the musical I made a few more detachable sleeve flounces with lace and a fichu out of the remaining fabric I had as accessories. I contemplated adding lace to the main gown, but liked it just as it was.</p>

		At this point, I also hadn't hemmed the main skirt… and didn't feel like doing it. I saw this style of a <a href="https://daniellefiore.blogspot.com/2018/06/ikea-ljusoga-robe-langlaise-1770-1780s.html">polonaised skirt on another robe a l'Anglaise</a>, and decided to do the same by some buttons to the back of the dress and yarn that loops from underneath the skirt, and hoops over the buttons to pull up the skirt fabrics. This way, it reveals a bit more of the lovely petticoat pattern underneath, while give the impression of a complex pleated / ruffled back skirt which I think added a lot to the skirt, especially given its rather plain fabric.</p>

		<p>As for accessorizing during the musical: I had a pearl necklace I borrowed from my mother, and some earrings that reminded me of chatelaines that would've typically been worn on the waistband of the petticoat. If I had more time, I think I would've looked to purchasing some chatelaines, gloves and maybe a hat to complete the look. But overall, I am very pleased with the outcome.</p>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>lthough sewing it was such a laborious process, every delirious moment of frenzied sewing was worth it! It humbled me greatly, and left me in awe of all the tailors that came before me for all the intricate gowns we have in history. Learning the history of fashion during that time period while sewing allowed me to appreciate the costuming of the musical a lot more as well.</p>
