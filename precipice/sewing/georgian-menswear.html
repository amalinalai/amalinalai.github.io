		<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>f you haven't already seen my <a href="robe-alanglaise.html">Robe A L'anglaise</a>, I explained in that page that I made historical outfits for my partner and I to go see Hamilton (the musical) in person! You can treat this almost like a Part 2 to that page. :)</p>
		
		<hr>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span> made use of the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/742999791/georgian-mens-coat-about-1790-sewing?pro=1">Georgian Mens Coat</a> and the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/734472080/georgian-mens-breeches-late-18th-century?pro=1">Georgian Mens Breeches</a> patterns from Black Snail Patterns on Etsy. Although the outfit would typically also be accompanied with a waistcoat, we decided to forgo it due to time constraints; after all, it likely would not have been that obvious under the coat.</p>

		<p>Big shoutout to my partner who helped me immensely for these garments. He assembled all the printed pattern pieces, helped trace them out on the fabric and even worked on the sewing machine after some initial guidance. I definitely would not have been able to finish everything in time for the musical had he not been around. He also paid for all the fabrics (which were sadly not on sale).</p>

		<p>We worked on the coat first out of navy cotton fabric, and while the patterns were all written for handsewing (as was historically accurate to the time period, since sewing machines didn't exist yet at that time), but it was straightforward to convert most of them for handsewing. I handsewed the lining pieces to the coat, and I did it so much that I am actually quite proud of how my stitches on the inside looked in the end.</p>
		

		<p>I love the exaggerated curves and the pleated back of the coat, although it made trying to minimize excess fabric waste difficult because certain pieces didn't tessellate quite as well. (Luckily, I managed to use all the excess fabric to stuff my bum roll for my Robe a L'anglaise.) The back pleats also had to be sewn in place by hand, and required a bit of measuring to ensure they were symmetrical on both sides. I was also surprised by how massive the pockets were — big enough to fit books inside! The coat also has lovely, interestingly-shaped pocket flaps which were so fun to sew.</p>

		<p>The sleeves I actually had to sew on and rip out a couple of times because I messed them up! Repeatedly! Once I sewed them on backwards… I was genuinely devastated I had to redo it because I think I was a little burnt out from the sewing projects by then. But I powered through and the coat came together soon enough.</p>

		<p>All the buttons I used in the coat were random bits and bobs I had lying around. So although the original design required multiple buttons on the front, with only two functional ones, I only had enough for two matching ones. Moreover, I actually sewed the buttons on the "wrong" side! Although my partner and I just say that he is left-handed anyway, so perhaps from a practical sword-drawing perspective, it maybe made sense that I had sewn the buttons on the other side.</p>

		<p>This was the point where I also learnt how to use the button hole functionality on my sewing machine! And it gave me so much trouble for reasons I still do not understand. I actually did a few button hole practices on some scrap fabric without any hitches, but for some reason on my first attempt on the actual coat, I faced so many issues I almost felt like giving up. Thankfully it all worked out in the end but… I don't know if it would've been faster had I just handsewn the buttonholes?!</p>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">F</span>inally, I moved on to the breeches with some light brown cotton fabric. The breeches were also pretty easy to construct with a sewing machine, and I only needed to handsew a few small details like the stitches to connect the main pants to the waistband on the inside.</p>

		<p>I think I found this garment the most fascinating because they were the most different from their modern day counterparts! Although from the exterior, the construction seems pretty similar to regular pants we have now, these breeches actually open up via a flap through the front. The flap is held in place by buttons on either sides of the waist. There are pockets accessible from the side of the pants, as you might see on regular khakis, except the pockets are actually situated behind the leg, instead of in front of them! Front pockets are instead accessible from a somewhat hidden opening slightly beneath the front waistband, positioned similarly to jean pockets. There's also an additional pocket in the front waistband that would hold a pocketwatch. The breeches according to the pattern would have a lace-up back, but I switched it up to hook and eye closures for easy assembly.</p>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>n the day of, my partner found some knee-length socks and a pair of loafers to complete the look. He also bought a small piece of white fabric he folded into a cravat, which I think really sells the look! If I had more time, I think I would maybe have shortened the breeches a little more and tailored everything to fit my partner a bit better. But overall, I'm really happy with how everything turned out, and I think he did too. :)</p>
