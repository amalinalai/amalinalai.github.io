		<h1>visibly mended ripped jeans</h1>
		
		<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>hese were originally Uniqlo ripped jeans I had thrifted in 2020 or so. They soon became my favourite pair of jeans: I loved the fit, feel and mobility of it. I wore them almost every week to uni lectures and dinners out alike, to the point that they became less "ripped jeans" and more "absolutely decimated by the washing machine jeans". The original ripped portions on the knees just became gaping holes, and while they were still <em>technically</em> wearable, I decided to give them a third lease of life instead of going out to thrift another pair of jeans.</p>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>t this point, I'd already learnt about visible mending and darned a few socks, so I thought it would be a perfect way to patch up the holes. In my research, I learnt about sashiko, a Japanese embroidery method that reinforces fabric using  running stitches while simultaneously creating beautiful (and potentially intricate) visible patterns on the fabric. I spent some time on Pinterest looking up other visible mending projects before starting on mine!</p>

		<figcaption>Starting the mending process, I first basted the patterned fabric beneath the large holes on the knee-portions of the jeans. I secured the fabrics within an embroidery hoop, then marked out grid patterns before starting on the stitching.</figcaption>

		<p>I used patterned fabric squares I already had in my stash, and an embroidery hoop I'd bought years ago. I picked a white fabric with swans as my primary fabric to patch the large holes, since they matched the light wash of my jeans pretty well. I first hemmed my fabric, then secured it right side to wrong side of the jean leg with a basting stitch. I then placed it within my embroidery hoop, and marked out grids using a washable fabric marker. I then began embroidering across both the fabrics, so that the running stitches would hold them in place. I tried different stitch patterns all around, finding some patterns on Youtube, and others on Pinterest.</p>

		<p>For smaller holes, I made smaller fabric patches out of a pastel green polka dot fabric to go above them. Similarly, I hemmed them before stitching them on with a basting stitch, then going over them with sashiko stitching. When all was done, I removed the basting stitches and added some cute iron-on patches (that have since fallen out, unfortunately).</p>
		
		<p>Overall, I'm really happy with how it turned out because I still love wearing this pair of jeans, and I think it makes for a unique pair of jeans that are a perfect conversation starter!</p>
