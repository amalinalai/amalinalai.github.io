		<h1>my sewing stash</h1>
		<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span> love talking, and I've done a few sewing projects myself, so why not share what I've made with some background and my thoughts about them here? So this will be a small collection of things I've sewn and am proud of. And hopefully, if my yapping is too long, there'll be some pretty pictures along the way.</p>

		<blockquote>to ibu & mama.</blockquote>
		<p>This page is dedicated to my mother, who taught me much of what I know about sewing. She taught me first how to handsew, then she showed me how to use her old Singer sewing machine, and then she bought the new machine I now use today.</p>
		<p>This page is also dedicated to my grandmother, who was a seamstress. We could never really communicate because of language barriers. I had wanted to show her pictures of my projects, as well as to make a traditional hanfu (with my newfound confidence in sewing) to wear on Lunar New Year to show her. She unfortunately passed before I could do either of those things.</p>
