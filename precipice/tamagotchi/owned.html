	<p>My first Tamagotchi was a pink Connection V5 (Familitchi) that was gifted to me secondhand. This was maybe in 2010 or so, but I don't have an exact year I can pinpoint. I remember not knowing at all what a Tamagotchi was, but having been gifted it by my brother's ex-girlfriend on a trip out to the Science Centre, I was definitely excited. I can't remember if I'd taken it out to play then and there, or if I'd held on to it, high with anticipation, the entire train ride home.</p>
	
	<p>On this version, you'd raise a family of 3 children! You can choose to have one of them marry after they all grow into adults, and your choices for marriage as well as care will affect the "type" of family you have.</p>
	
	<p>The memory that stands out to me most about the Familitchi was being able to log onto the computer, go on the website (TAMA & Earth Expo) and play games to win points gotchi points or prizes. You'd get a code at the end of your time on the website and key it into the device to receive your winnings. But reading the wiki page on the local games available on the device also brings back memories of playing them!</p>
	
	<p>I don't recall when I'd stopped playing it, but I remember picking it back up maybe a few years ago? Not for long though, but I still kept the tamagotchi after all these years and I'm glad I did! I'd love to someday play it again, and maybe see if there are fan versions of TAMA & Earth Expo that I can still play on.</p>
	
	<h2 id="uni">uni</h2>
	<div class="device right">
	<img src="devices/uni.png" alt="My Tamagotchi uni in rose gold.">
	</div>
	<p>In August 2024, after rediscovering Tamagotchis (and realizing people still played it!), I bought my second device, the Uni. Prior to purchase I'd read up on the device and watched a few review videos about me. I'll be honest and say that what sold me on it was the walking feature! As someone who enjoys taking walks, I thought this was a lovely feature that meshed well with my own habits.</p>
	
	<p>What surprised me was how low-maintenance this device was, and as a working adult I do appreciate the sitter so much! Sometimes I'm just low on energy, or wish to focus on my work, and being able to put my tamas with a sitter is a well-appreciated feature.</p>
	
	<p>I also like being able to decorate the main room as well as dress up your tamas: it gives so much unique personality to them because of the number of permutations possible. Although some items and accessories are time-limited or region-exclusive, I actually find that I don't mind it that much, surprisingly! It's nice that you can still get some of the accessories through the Tama Fashion store on the TamaVerse.</p>
	
	<p>I do wish that there were more games to play on the device! I hope they someday add more in; although there are new activities through the Tama Arena or through DLCs, it would be nice to have some of them become a permanent game on the base device itself.</p>
