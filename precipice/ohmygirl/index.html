		  <p>Welcome to my little Oh My Girl shrine. They're one of the few groups I've kept up with for almost a decade, and I love pretty much every song they put out. Listening to their songs makes me happy!</p>
		  <p>They've been on the top spot in my Spotify Wrapped for the last few years consecutively, and their music has followed alongside my growth into adulthood.</p>
		  <p>They have left a huge impact on me, so <b><u>this page is very long!!!</u></b> Make sure to make a nice cup of coffee or tea, get cozy and take your time reading this. I hope you enjoy your stay here. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/shy.gif" alt="shy"></p>

		<figcaption>Members of Oh My Girl, from left to right: Mimi, Yubin, YooA, Hyojung, Seunghee and Arin.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Oh My Girl is a 6-member South Korean K-pop girl group which debuted in 2015 under WM Entertainment. They originally debuted with 8 members, but JinE and Jiho left the group in 2017 and 2022 respectively. The current members are Hyojung, Mimi, YooA, Seunghee, Yubin and Arin.</p>
		<p>Despite being the sister company to B1A4, a then-popular boy group, Oh My Girl only hit mainstream success years after their debut. They won their first music show award in 2018 with the title track <i>Secret Garden</i>, and won the Bonsang award at the Seoul Music Awards, twice in a row, a few years later in 2020 and 2021.</p>
		<p>The girls have been dubbed 'concept fairies' for their ethereal, dream-like songs, but their discography also includes many bright songs that are perfect for warm summer days.</p>
		<p>One of their members, YooA, also debuted as a solo artist in 2020.</p>
		
		<h1 id="relwith">my relationship with oh my girl</h1>
		
		<h2 id="beginnings">the beginnings!</h2>
		<p>My first encounter with K-pop had been in 2012, where school friends introduced me to groups like Girls Generation (SNSD), f(x), Miss A, 2NE1 and most notably, B1A4. I remember loading K-pop songs on my Creative MP3 player from Youtube videos, and how, on the cusp of slumber, the tunes of <i>Bubble Pop</i>, <i>Bad Girl Good Girl</i> and the like would carry me towards unconsciousness. After I moved schools the year after, I stopped listening to K-pop.</p>

		<p>In 2016, I'd chanced upon a BTS dance practice video through some classmates, and feeling nostalgic, I went back to look up B1A4 to listen to some of the old songs I used to really like from them. To my surprise, they had a new sister group, Oh My Girl, so out of curiosity, I checked out the girls' latest music video, <i>Closer</i>.</p>

		<div class="video-caption"><p>Their <i>Closer</i> music video.</p></div>
		
		<p>It was love at first listen. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/happy-cry.gif" alt="happy crying"> I'd never heard anything like it; haunting and magnetic, the whole video gripped all of my senses in a way I'd never felt before. So drawn, I recall looking up an analysis of the music video that brought me to tears. I remember being so in awe after reading that their dance choreography incorporated the shape of constellations outlined by their positions during the dance that you could see from above.</p>

		<p>I must have fallen down some rabbit hole somehow, because before I knew it, I was watching all their music stages, their appearances on Korean TV shows, and soon, their mini 'reality' show. I had a bias, was following their socials, and was excitedly awaiting their next comeback. And the next one, and then the next one. They were the music I listened to on the way home, while I was doing my homework, and even while I was studying for my A-levels. I even recall hiding away in the toilet at 5 p.m. during one of my jobs to watch the music video for <i>Secret Garden</i> as soon as it was released. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/shy.gif" alt="shy"></p>
		
		<p>They were my way back into K-pop; I began to listen to many other groups until around 2019 or so. There was SF9, NCT, Stray Kids, LOONA, and Oh My Girl's younger brother group, ONF. And yet, Oh My Girl has been the only group that I've still been consistently listening to after all these years.</p>
		
		<img src="images/divider.png" class="divider" alt="">
		
		<h2 id="goodbad">good or bad fan?</h2>
		<p>The thing about K-pop is that it wasn't just about the music. You could build such a strong, sometimes almost obsessive, parasocial relationship with the members because of the nature of the content that came with their music promotions. They would often appear on variety shows to promote their music which often had some amount of fanservice involved, asking their guests to perform <i>aegyo</i> (acting cute) directed towards the camera (i.e. viewer). But these shows were also ways you could learn more about your favourite members, and feel connected to them. They were often funny, healing and took your mind off daily stresses. </p>
		
		<p>On top of variety shows, the members could also host livestreams on specific platforms for Korean stars. They could take you on a trip to the bingsu store, have karaoke sessions, or just talk to you through the night. And although I was actively listening to them and watching their music show stages, I actually didn't religiously keep up with all their variety show appearances or Vlives. In part because I was a student who couldn't commit all my time to watching them, but also in part because I couldn't fully understand Korean.</p>
		
		<p>Oh My Girl, having been still a relatively small group in their earlier years, had many videos that didn't have English subtitles. There weren't enough fan translators, and that meant that I didn't have any incentive to keep up with their Vlives or variety show appearances. I still watched what I could, but as a teenager, it consequently made me wonder whether I was a 'genuine' or 'real' fan if I didn't somehow keep up with everything.</p>
		
		<p>I did feel a certain (maybe self-imposed) pressure to keep up, but I'm just glad that I didn't fall further into that mindset. I listened and watched at my own pace and gradually learnt to be happy with that. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/content.gif" alt="contented"></p></p>
		
		<img src="images/divider.png" class="divider" alt="">
		
		<h2 id="firstwin">their first music show win</h2>
		<p>While I may not have religiously watched all of their videos, I was still very emotionally attached to them as a group. There's a certain sense of happiness and pride seeing the group succeed.</p>
		<p>While they were promoting <i>Secret Garden</i>, I'd decided to try and vote for them on a music show via text message. Voting was a way to help your favourite K-pop group win music show awards, since they counted towards a portion of the score that would be used to assess the winner of that evening's episode.</p>
		<p>I'd previously only voted for them for their Mnet appearances, which allowed for international voters via their website, but they rarely stood a chance against bigger groups with larger international followings. I didn't even know if my text would count, being from an international number, but I was compelled to do it anyway. That evening, after sending in my vote, I put my phone aside and went to have dinner.</p>

		<div class="video-caption"><p>Their first music show win for <i>Secret Garden</i> in 2018. The video includes the stage performance they did, and their acceptance speech at the end of the show where the winners are announced.</p></div>
		
		<p>I came back to news that Oh My Girl had won their first music show ever. I cried.</p>
		
		<p>There's something so poetic about them winning their first music show after so many years of struggling while performing a song about nurturing your dreams in hopes of it blooming. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/happy-cry.gif" alt="happy crying"></p>
		
		<p>It's sad to belated learn that the moment for them must have felt even more forceful, knowing that had <i>Secret Garden</i> been a commercial failure (i.e. not winning any music show awards), they'd have disbanded as group. It was their final chance to break out, and they'd managed to grasp at it just in time to watch their own dreams bloom into a fragile flower.</p>
		
		<img src="images/divider.png" class="divider" alt="">
		
		<h2 id="departure">member departures</h2>
		<p>JinE left the group in 2017 for health issues, after an extended hiatus while receiving treatment for anorexia nervosa. The news broke while I was in the library in school studying for my A-levels. If I recall, there was a handwritten note posted on their fancafe (a forum where they could interact with fans or post updates), and fan accounts were scrambling to translate it.</p>

		<p>It was probably the first time I had been so invested in a group (born too late for the 90s boy bands, and somehow managed to avoid sinking into the depths of One Direction fandom despite liking some of their songs), and consequently, I was actually quite heartbroken at the news. Frankly, I don't remember much else, except that it was a heavy weight on my heart as I went home. Many years later, she made an Instagram account that I promptly followed, and she seems to be doing well over the years. I hope she finds happiness wherever she goes.</p>

		<p>When Jiho later left in 2022 to pursue acting, I think my reaction was a little different. Yes, I was a little sad, but I think being around the time that I'd just graduated from uni, I could also understand the desire to explore and experience something different. She'd joined the idol life when she was still a teenager, and seven years later, as a young adult who'd struggled with anxiety through those years an idol, it made sense to me that she might want to pivot into something else.</p>

		<p>Although it's been two years since her departure and announcement of joining a different management company for acting, I actually have not seen any news about her. It doesn't seem like she's acted in any film, TV shows or webseries. I'm not sure if she's still pursuing acting, and her Instagram is also sparse with any updates. Either way, I'm wishing her well! <img class="emotes" src="emotes/grin.gif" alt="grin"></p></p>
		
		<img src="images/divider.png" class="divider" alt="">
		
		<h2 id="collection">my album collection</h2>
		<p>While I didn't watch every video or show they were involved in, I did make an effort to purchase and collect all of their albums.</p>
		
		<p>If I'm not wrong didn't start preordering albums until <i>Secret Garden</i>, where I had a little more money from working part time. Prior to that, I think I only had the <i>Closer</i> album, which I'd bought for $5 secondhand, and <i>Windy Day</i>, which I'd bought weeks after their comeback.</p>
		
		<p>During their <i>Secret Garden</i> era, they had a brand deal with Nene Chicken, a Korean fried chicken brand that had outlets in Singapore. Nene Chicken held a giveaway for signed versions of 3 of their albums: <i>Listen to My World</i>, <i>Coloring Book</i> and <i>Secret Garden</i>. Each receipt of purchase of their meals earned you a chance to win, and I somehow convinced my family and friends to eat a lot of spicy korean fried chicken during that time... but it all paid off! <img class="emotes" src="emotes/grin.gif" alt="grin"> I won the giveaway! I remember the sheer excitement and joy as I collected my prize, its weight heavy in my bag on the way home.</p>
		
		<p>I also later bought <i>Pink Ocean</i> secondhand for $5, including the photocard which was such a good deal. That pretty much rounded off my entire collection as I continued to pre-order their future releases, except I was missing their first album (which was out of print by then and selling at exorbitant prices), and a limited edition pink version of <i>Banana Allergy Money</i>.</p>
		
		<figure>
		<img src="images/albums.png" alt="">
		<figcaption>My album collection as of 2020, complete (sans the limited edition album I gave up on). I also have the lightstick, as well as some Oh My Girl banners, including one I designed (at the top). The first album is the white one tucked behind on the left side of the image.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>For awhile I didn't have the first album, but I finally bit the bullet to buy it at like... $80 (I know...) secondhand. A few months after, they started reprinting the first album again, and I felt like I wasted so much money! If I'd just waited a little more I might have actually gotten it at a reasonable price, but what's done is done I guess.</p>
		
		<p>A friend once told me never to finish a collection: the thrill of an incomplete collection is pining for the missing item, and the feeling of finishing it falls flat in comparison. It reminds me a little of how in gambling, the high in the moments before you win or lose, where your nerves are vibrating with anticipation, is far greater than the joy of winning. I guess in some ways, I realized what he said was true after I bought the first album and finished my album collection. There wasn't anything to "look forward to" now that I had all the albums (except the limited edition one which I've completely given up on). You make the purchase, you're excited about it before you collect it and... it goes on the shelf to display.</p>
		
		<p>I don't think a lot about my album collection now, but they all sit neatly up on my shelf.</p>
		
		<img src="images/divider.png" class="divider" alt="">
		
		<h2 id="tumblr">my tumblr artworks!</h2>
		<p>There was a period of time in 2018 where I had a few fan accounts on Tumblr where I would make graphics for my favourite K-pop groups, including Oh My Girl. The blogs have since been deactivated, but remnants of my craft still remains online through reblogs.</p>
		
		<p>A funny tangent, but I'd started with Oh My Girl, then afterwards made a LOONA side account later on when I got into them. Because of the difference in fandom sizes of the two groups, my LOONA account became so much more popular, with my <a href="https://loonagfxs.tumblr.com/post/174328190404/the-loonaverse-as-a-video-game">most popular graphic racking in almost two thousand notes</a> (reblogs and likes on Tumblr). Meanwhile, my Oh My Girl account remained pretty lowkey, with my graphics capping at about 100 or so notes only.</p>
		
		<p>In any case, I still made some graphics and gifs for Oh My Girl. The graphics tended to be made based on lyrics of their songs, with <a href="https://femadols.tumblr.com/post/170203554385/">this <i>Knock Knock</i> one being my favourite</a>. It was a nice way to express my love and interest for this group by sharing art with other fans, and honestly whatever I'd learnt from making these graphics on Photoshop are skills I still use to this day.</p>

		<h2 id="distance">from obsessed, to calm adoration at a distance</h2>
		<p>Obviously, as I got a lot busier with university, I couldn't invest much time into Oh My Girl, or K-pop in general. Moreover, I think after their first win, their activity slowed slightly, with a new album every year or so, instead of multiple new releases per year.</p>
		
		<p>Leaving Twitter and then Instagram after also meant that I no longer had instant updates about the group or their activities and new releases. I became a lot more of a casual listener after that. I wasn't watching every music stage, or looking up every new video of them. I didn't even watch music videos as soon as they released as I used to either.</p>
		
		<p>I'd listen to the album on the bus, then maybe watch the music video and a few of their stage performances. I'd only watch Youtube videos of them if they popped up. It didn't mean that I stopped loving them. I still buy their albums, still stream their songs enough to be in their top listeners on Spotify. Nevertheless, it still makes me feel bittersweet thinking about this difference in my actions and attitude. To have Oh My Girl be such a big part of my life and joy then become a smaller share of that experience... my heart constricts at that thought, while still understanding that it's not wrong or shameful. But I guess this is one of the ways growing up changes us and our relationship to the things around us.</p>
		
		<p>to round up this excessively long portion of this page, <img class="emotes" src="emotes/shy.gif" alt="shy"> here's what I had to say in 2020 about them:</p>
		<blockquote><p>ohmygirl is rly the group I grew up with from sec sch to jc to uni, and it makes me kinda emotional to think that in a way their group has grown together with me? from being a grp nobody knew about in 2015, to winning their first show in 2018, to steadily gaining popularity in korea in the last couple of years, to me their group really embodies the sometimes slow and difficult journey of achieving your dreams. If anything they're a group I'm proud of listening to, loving, and supporting! ❤️</p></blockquote>
		
		<h1 id="relfrom">the relationships oh my girl granted me</h1>
		<p>Beyond the obvious happiness they brought me from their performances and music, something else I've always appreciated is the connections I've made as a consequence of my love for Oh My Girl.</p>
		
		<h2 id="classmate">classmate turned close friend</h2>
		<p>In 2016, I sat beside an old classmate during a lecture. We had been classmates 3-4 years ago, and while we had talked on shared bus rides home we weren't necessarily the closest of friends. I hadn't really talked to her since we switched classes, but that particular day, we found each other. I don't know why, but somehow at the end of the lecture one of us had brought up Oh My Girl, and it was there that we both came to the happy realization of our shared interest in Oh My Girl.</p>
		<p>That prompted an agreement to meet every week (or fortnight?) for lunches to talk, even if only for half an hour, somehow fitting each other in for two years despite different schedules.</p>
		<p>At the end of the two years, we were ready to say goodbye as we headed off to university. Except, we realized we'd both be in the same scholars programme, taking much of the same classes for the first two years, living in the same on-school accomodations. And that is how we became roommates, and how she became one of my closest friends and confidante through university. I don't think I'd have survived freshman year without her.</p>
		
		<p>To think it was the sheer luck of things lining up the way they did, and of course, because of our shared interest in Oh My Girl that brought us together like that! She doesn't yet know of my website, but if one day she reads this: I love you so much! <img class="emotes" src="emotes/grin.gif" alt="grin"> Thank you for being such a core part of my life.</p>

		<h2 id="conacq">fanmeet & concert acquaintances</h2>
		<p>When Oh My Girl was coming to Singapore for a fanmeeting (mini concert?), I'd bought tickets fully thinking I'd go alone. I don't remember how, but somehow I'd managed to get involved with Singapore’s OHMYGIRL fanbase who wanted to organize a fan project for the day of the fan meet. The group of us came together and worked on different aspects of the fan project: the others worked on the fanbanners that was to be given out for free to the audience members, as well as food for the girls, while I worked on liasing with bakeries and editing the fan video.</p>
		<figure>

		<figcaption>Left: me (right) and another fan at the fanmeet with the fanbanner. Right: All of us who were part of the project standing in a circle with our tickets.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>I talk more about the concert in the next section, but I'm thankful that I got to engage in the local fan community in this way. While I think it would've been fun to go alone, it was a really cool chance to be involved, spending the time before the fanmeet with the people I'd been working with on the fanprojects for the weeks prior added so much more to my first ever concert experience. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/joy.gif" alt="joy">

		<figcaption>Me (left) at a cafe event in 2020 for Oh My Girl with two others I met from the first fanmeeting in 2018.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Through this first event, I later got to meet even more local Oh My Girl fans. I still keep in touch with some of them! I even went to Halloween Horror Nights, a local Halloween event, in 2020 with them.</p>
		
		<h1 id="concert">my concert experiences</h1>
		<h2 id="fanmeet">first fanmeet</h2>
		<p>A fanmeet is like a mini-concert. For the Oh My Girl concert, they performed songs, but also had mini-games in between performances! Words cannot contain just how excited I was to find out that they were coming to Singapore. I was ready as soon as the ticket sales were open, and bought tickets in the center, first row. I'd also never been to a concert prior to this, so you can imagine how nervous I was as well.</p>
		<p>As I mentioned, I joined up with some local fans to do a fan project for the concert, so it made the days leading up to the concert even more involved. Because the event was in May, Mimi's birth month, we wanted to get a cake for the members and managed to liase with the fanmeet organizers to allow for this. I think we collectively designed the cakes together, but I was in charge of reaching out to bakeries. Rooting through my old email, I found my sketches! <img class="emotes" src="emotes/smile.gif" alt="smile"> We did end up changing the final design in the end together with the bakery's input, but it's kind of surreal to think that I was part of it somehow!</p>

		<figcaption>The final cake design, with Mimi holding it! This image was originally posted on their Twitter, I think! I had to find it through a Pinterest save of it...</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>I'm also so thankful that I got to make and edit fan video that we got the organizers to play during the event. I worked on most of it, including animating the intro screen, but had help from someone else with sourcing for the videos! <img class="emotes" src="emotes/content.gif" alt="contented"> Shout out to 19 year old me for documenting my entire fanmeet experience because I genuinely have no recollection of these details, but I have this wonderful quote about how I felt while watching the girls (and the entire venue!) watch the fan video:</p>
		
		<blockquote><p>So the emcee got them to talk about how the felt that day… BUT IT GOT INTERRUPTED HALFWAY BY MY FAN VIDEO !!!!!!! AND they watched my work… brb WHILE I SCREAM</p>
		<p>They were like “omg wow!!!” and they were laughing when they looked at the really fun memories i chose and even tho my fancam sucked once more their laughters were captured and I just!!! My heart!!! And I was really close to crying… like can I say… after editing the video so many times i felt like i became immune to emotions watching the video but then watching it with oh my girl… i honestly felt choked up… and then the part where ohmygirl’s first win came up and everyone at the venue screamed and I was just like shit ;;</p>

		<p>With these people I'd met through this fanproject, I also went to the airport to see them! I made a pencil drawing to give to them, and just when I thought I wouldn't be able to pass it to any of them because they were just walking by so quickly, Seunghee stopped and took it from me! Later on, in a Vlive (livestream) they did, we spotted my drawing on their hotel bed for a split second which... frankly broke me (in a good way) at that time. Actually we were all screaming in the group chat, I'm pretty sure. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/laugh.gif" alt="laugh"> Having your idols not only receive your gift, but the concrete realization of the hopes of them perceiving it!!</p>

I had passed the drawing in a clear file to Seunghee, together with a handwritten card.<br><br> Bottom: A blurry screenshot of the livestream, where a few of us caught sight of my drawing on the hotel bed of one of the members. I'm not sure if the dark shadow beside is the card that I passed along with the drawing!</figcaption>

		<p>Okay, honestly talking about this concert could be a whole separate document on its own. But to put it simply: I had a lot of fun! I was genuinely so happy, I couldn't sleep after the concert ended. There were plenty of opportunities for fanservice: Arin, my bias, noticed me, Yubin sent me a flying kiss, Mimi sent me finger guns etc etc... <img class="emotes" src="emotes/shy.gif" alt="shy">. I also got a photo-op and hi-touch (you basically high-five them as you walk down the line) opportunity with them. For my photo-op, I actually won a special lottery where we could have the photo taken with less of us on stage, compared to the regular one. So I got to interact more personally with YooA for the photo and it was just... pure bliss I think. Obviously writing retrospectively, I have a much more dulled sense of how I felt that night, but thankfully I wrote everything out, so here is it, in its full glory:</p>
		
		<blockquote><p>So it ended officially and we waited a bit for hi touch, I was one of the last ones because i was one of the first few rows!!! But I didn’t really have time to say what I prepared… just managed to tell them I loved them and to thank them!! I made sure to look in their eyes and smile at them AND OH GOD LIKE SERIOUSLY THEY ARE SO SO SOOOO BEAUTIFUL ITS CRAZY I FEEL LIKE A POTATO NEXT TO THEM EEK it was rly too fast I wish I had more time!!!! But security was rushing all of us :(</p>

		<p>But anw told seunghee to rest well, and I told arin in korean that we are the same age (thank u so much beverley for telling me how to do this!!) and because of that ARIN WAS LIKE “OH!!” AND DID THE FINGER GUN AT ME!!!! Oof my heart and because the security was rushing us I had to turn back and she was looking @ me as I walked away MY HEART!!!!!!!</p>
		
		<p>So as I said I got the opportunity to have 5 fans in a photo with the girls instead of 15 people!!!! So thankful!!! So our photo was last when everyone left already, and I managed to kneel in front of yooa!</p> 

		<p>So I told her “heart?” and I showed her the pose I was going to do, which was holding my hands above my head to form a v shape and she would help me complete my heart using her own hands (as the ohmygirl sg admin told me)!! and she was like “heart? Ok!” so I was like ok!!!! And I put my hands up not really knowing what to expect since I couldn’t see her after I turned forward, then suddenLY I FELT HER FINGERS HOLDING ON TO MINE AND SHE WAS HELPING ME LIKE MAKE THE V-SHAPE I MADE WITH MY HANDS WIDER AND LIKE i kind of squealed out loud because I was surprised and then yooa giggled?? Laughed?? At my squeal and then I could feel the fabric of her dress on my hand AND I JUST DIED INSIDE i hope i look somewhat acceptable in the photo… but im rly happy nonetheless. rly rly thankful for this experience HOLY SHIT yooa steal my heart already she’s so gorgeous and sweet and she was rly cute and at the end I turned around to tell her I love her and thank the other members!! But security rushed us off once more</p>

		<p>Thinking back, I think I probably embarassed myself with how much energy and sheer joy I outwardly expressed towards them... but it wasn't something I could hold in!</p>

		<p>In 2020, Oh My Girl came back to Singapore for HallyuPopFest, which is kind of like K-Con where multiple artists come down to perform a few songs each. Once again I helped out in a fan project, and I designed the banner we gave out to other Oh My Girl fans for free! <img class="emotes" src="emotes/grin.gif" alt="grin"> There were a few iterations but this was the final design that people voted on.</p>

		<p>There was also a photo-op which I was super stoked for, since it meant I got to meet the girls again in person. The ticket I'd bought for HallyuPopFest were much farther away this time, so it wasn't like the first fanmeet where I was in the front row. The K-pop group with which you got a photo-op for is actually given out randomly, but I managed to trade my non-Oh My Girl pass for an Oh My Girl one with another girl at the festival!</p>

		<figcaption>Top: The photo from the second photo-op, with me seated in front of Mimi (all the way on the left)! This one was a lot stricter than my first photo-op with them, and we were ushered into the seats. I managed to tell Mimi that I'd designed the banner I was holding before they took the photo.<br><br>Bottom: Seated with some of the people I'd met in 2018 for the first fanmeet fan project!</figcaption>

		<p>While I already knew some people from the first fanmeeting, I got to meet more local (and even overseas) fans through the banner fanproject we worked on! We spent the whole day together and looking back, I think it's so nice how music can bring strangers together in this way.</p>
		
		<p>Even though Oh My Girl only performed a few songs, I enjoyed my whole day at the concert. It was fun just vibing and listening to other groups, cheering for them and overall just having a good time. <img class="emotes" src="emotes/joy.gif" alt="joy"></p>
