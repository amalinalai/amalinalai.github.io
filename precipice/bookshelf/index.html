	<p>Listed here are books I've read (recently) and enjoyed. The books that continue to linger in my memory, errant thoughts that find their way to the front of my mind in random moments. The books that had me reeling after turning the last page, sat at the edge of my bed with a heavy feeling in my chest, deep in sorrow, or contemplation, or catharsis. Whether they've unsettled me, soothed me, changed me or trapped me in its beguiling threads, I hope you find these books equally magnetic.</p>
	<p>Clicking on the titles will give you my review of them.</p>

	<h2>Giovanni's Room</h2>
	<h3>James Baldwin</h3>
	<h4>Last read: 9 Jun 2024</h4>
	<img src="icons/giovannis-room.png" alt="A drawing of a rectangular window, with vague shadowy figures at the left and right edges of the window.">
	</summary>
	<p><i>Giovanni's Room</i> is written from the perspective of David, an American man, who finds himself entangled in a romance with a bartender he meets in Paris, Giovanni, while David's girlfriend travels to Spain to decide whether she wants to settle down with him after he proposes to her. Having no money, David ends up moving into Giovanni's room as their affair develops.</p>
	<p>Baldwin has such a way with words — there is a beautifully haunting quality about his writing that continues to chill me when I think about it. In such a succint text, he manages to spin a heart-wrenching tale of guilt, shame, internalized homophobia and masculinity that affected me in ways I hadn't expected. To me, his writing exacts a sense of urgency to hurry the story along, only to have me reeling and grasping at the walls to stop myself from staring down an abyss, far too late. Long after finishing the book, my mind still ambles towards it in contemplation and reverence.</p>

	<h2>The Memory Police<h2>
	<h3>yoko ogawa</h3>
	<h4>Last read: 29 Oct 2023</h4>
	<img src="icons/the-memory-police.png" alt="A 2-dimensional drawing of a sakura flower with five petals.">
	</summary> 
	<p>The book is set on an island where things start to disappear, along with memories relating to those objects, and the Memory Police works to ensure that these things remain forgotten, taking away people suspected of remembering.</p>
	<p>A sci-fi dystopian story that at first seems reminiscent of 1984, it soon proves itself to be starkly different from its genre counterparts. There is no archetypal hero character who goes to uncover some big plot, or fight against a Big Bad as you might come to expect after reading a handful of YA dystopia. Readers who go in wanting to find answers, or action-packed plot points may find it disappointing, but I found myself so emotionally drawn and invested in the tense atmosphere Ogawa creates with her almost-prescriptive, unassuming prose. In some ways, <i>The Memory Police</i> felt less like a typical book or story, and more like a meditation on loss, grief and memory, and it is somehow more relatable that way.</p>
	<p>What I enjoyed a lot about this was the story within a story: we have the story of the island, promised on the cover of the book, but we also have another story written by the protagonist of the book. We go back and forth between the two stories througout, and I am not sure if it was a flaw of my digital copy, but at some points there were no indicators of where the scene from the layered story begins and where the other ends, blurring the lines between the two. Because of the way scenes were interwoven, they played off each other and left me contemplating the two stories together, finding ways to interpret each of them in relation to one another.

	<h2>Babel</h2>
	<h3>rf kuang</h3>
	<h4>Last read: 28 Feb 2024</h4>
	<img src="icons/babel.png" alt="A 3-dimensional drawing of a silver bar with an inscription on its widest surface.">
	</summary>
	<p>Set in an alternate, magical history, <i>Babel</i> tells the tale of a boy taken from his home in Canton and enrolled in Oxford years later in the Royal Institute of Translation. Here, they learn of the magic that runs the country: meanings lost in translation captured in silver bars, making non-native speakers from British colonies extremely valuable in building up the British empire's dominance.</p>
	<p>This book is extremely long, being probably one of the longest books I've read in awhile, but at no point did I feel like it was excessively so. It's clear Kuang is well-versed in linguistics and the history of British colonialism, and at some points the writing can come across a bit heavy handed because of the sheer amount of knowledge and research reflected in the writing. This book came to me at a time when the Palestinian struggle had come back into the public consciousness, and I was finding it difficult to develop and justify my perspective on violence and struggle. It is with the context of seeing violent struggle in the face of oppression, and learning of historically violent struggles towards liberation, that I read this book and found it valuable in shaping my perspectives, and remains a book whose core themes I often think about.</p>
	<p>"Decolonization is always a violent event. [...] The colonized becomes a man through the process of liberation. Therefore, decolonization, implies the need to challenge the colonial situation – the status quo. 'The last shall be first'. It can only succeed by resorting to every means, including violence." — Frantz Fanon.</p>

	<h2>Tender is The Flesh</h2>
	<h3>agustina bazterrica</h3>
	<h4>Last read: 22 March 2023</h4>
	<img src="icons/tender-is-the-flesh.png" alt="A drawing of a cleaver.">
	</summary>
	<p>Set in a future where a virus has rendered animal meat inedible, society has turned towards eating human meat: humans are now bred in captivity to be then slaughtered to meet the demands for such consumption. Our protagonist works in a slaughterhouse, but finds himself gifted one such "specimen" he begins to care for, forcing him to re-evaluate his position and role in this aspect of society.</p>
	<p>This book is absolutely horrifying in its brutality and violence. It's hard not to have visceral reactions to it — ones of disgust and a sense of moral wrongness constantly came up through my read. But there was a sense of morbid curiosity amidst the disorienting and strange setting of the book that left me turning the pages despite my horror. There are different ways one might interpret and read the story, (e.g. the extent of human evils and greed) but for me what came out strongly was a thinly-veiled allegory for our animal farming practices and how many of us are willing to turn a blind eye, or simply pay lip service to animal welfare / environmental concerns, because doing anything else would mean having to potentially sacrifice certain comforts we have. Moreover, the concept of the power of words in how we encounter and justify our morality was interesting to me. The ending (spoilers!) left me betrayed; some may not enjoy it, because it seems to render the entire book pointless, but I thought it was an apt ending that triggers self-reflection over giving us a 'feel good' conclusion to the story without much work on our part.</p>

	<h2>Biography of X</h2>
	<h3>Catherine Lacey</h3>
	<h4>Last read: 17 July 2024</h4>
	<img src="icons/biography-of-x.png" alt="A drawing of a head and neck mannequin with no facial features. It has a short bob and side-swept bangs.">
	</summary>
	<p><i>Biography of X</i> is a fictional work written in the manner of a non-fiction biography of the late artist, X, by her widow, CM Lucca. Through her life, X took on different personalities, creating works of art and music that were both controversial and adored, cementing her place as an influential figure in modern art. Despite her fame, little is known of X's history or private life in general, as CM begins to find out in her attempt to research and reconstruct a truthful representation of X.</p>
	<p>I absolutely devoured this book. Written from the perspective Lucca, there is a quiet desperation in the voice, intermingled with love, and sometimes even hatred that drew me in, as she tries to unravel the mysteries of X. To treat the text at face value and seek a cohesive, "accurate" representation of who X was would be to do it a disservice, because I think there are a lot of interesting questions and concepts to be unpacked on not only identity, love, performance and art, but also on the medium of the text itself.</p>
	<p>In what is reminiscent of Brian D'Oherty's text, <i>The White Cube is Not Neutral</i>, which argues that while a gallery space is thought to be free of influence and a 'neutral' space for art, when it in fact has symbolic value that gets imparted on the viewing of artworks within its space, <i>Biography of X</i>, in its format underscores the biases that are imbued into biographical works, through its unbiased, griefing (and unreliable) narrator, Lucca, as well as in the collection of interviews that constitute the basis of a posthumous biography. (The latter, in particular, reminded me of how we tend to avoid speaking ill of the dead, and the influence that has on how we synthesize memories and ideas of people who have passed.) What we find is a messy web of recollection of an elusive figure, disjointed and dubious in its accuracy.</p>
	<p>It puts into question a unified truth of the identity of a person, forcing us to confront the scary prospect that what we know of the ones closest to us, and even ourselves, may only form a sliver or fragment of something bigger. I was fascinated through the book, and the inclusion of photographs to sell the reality of this alternate history within the book was a nice surprise and I really enjoyed this book in its ambition and execution.</p>

	<h2>The Empress of Salt and Fortune</h2>
	<h3>Nghi Vo</h3>
	<h4>Last read: 3 July 2024</h4>
	<img src="icons/empress-of-salt-and-fortune.png" alt="A simple drawing of the head of a rabbit.">
	</summary>
	<p>A short, fantastical story of Cleric Chih and their hoopoe who go down to an abandoned palace to recordkeep and sort through the remaining artefacts of the place. In the palace, they meet Rabbit, a royal servant to the recently deceased Empress In-yo. Almost every chapter presents different objects found throughout the palace, accompanied by a relevant retelling of a memory of the palace and the Empress from Rabbit.</p>
	<p>There is such a magical, dream-like quality to Vo's writing. The prose is gorgeous and visually magnetic, and despite the rather short length of it, the novel manages to pack so much of the world and history into it. Every chapter reveals something new, building up the world and the universe without excessive or explicit expository text. Because of this, reading the book does require some work on the part of the reader to connect the dots, but I especially enjoyed that part of it! No words felt wasted, and I think the manner of writing lets the work feel rich without being too heavy or dense.</p>

	<p>Sharing this list of books and my thoughts on them in such a public place is extremely daunting: the people-pleasing side of myself fears someone will disagree with my opinions. But I am reminding myself that having differences in taste is completely normal! This is, in part, an exercise in confronting that fear.</p>
