	<p>The trees seem to close in on you as you move deeper in. Here, sunlight only makes it through tiny pockets of space between the foliage, rays dancing about you as you take another step forward. You look above you, and a yellow bird cocks its head at you, giving a loud call that echoes through the forest. Then, it flies away, leaving nothing else but rustling leaves, and the bird calls in response.</p>
	<p>As you continue into the depths of the forest, the sunlight seem to slowly dim about you as the canopy begins to meld and merge into each other. Ahead of you, the path seems to only get darker, until the point in the horizon fades into black. The calls of the forest seem to have grown distant; you are distinctly aware of the sound of your breathing against the empty soundscape of your surroundings. A cold chill sends a shiver down your spine. You turn to look back at the bright spot from where you came from.</p>

	<summary>Forge ahead into darkness?</summary>
	<p>You decide to keep walking, straight into the darkness. There is nothing but the soft crunching of leaves beneath your feet and your laboured breathing as the ground slopes upwards. You stumble on a thick root of an old tree, but manage to reach out to its trunk to catch yourself. It's hard to make out anything now, but it's likely too late to head back â€” it's far more dangerous to climb downwards in the dark, than it is to keep heading upwards.</p>
	<p>There is nothing but a general sense of 'forward' that guides you.</p>
	<p>The time seems to pass slowly, your other senses so heightened by the lack of sight, until finally, a sliver of light peeks from just over the top of the hill you've been climbing. You keep climbing, a renewed sense of hope thrumming through you. As you take your final step to the peak of the hill, what greets you takes your breath away.</p>
	<p>Beneath you, the forest clears into a luscious opening, grass bed speckled with the whites and yellows of wildflowers that seem to glimmer under the golden rays of the slowly setting sun.</p>

	<summary>Head towards the clearing?</summary>
	<p>You head towards the clearing, mulch and dirt beneath you slowly turning to soft grass blades. The sunlight feels warm and comforting on your face. You sit here for awhile, letting the birdsongs and cricket calls lull you into a long-needed slumber.</p>
	<p>When you wake after what seems like a long time, full from the gentle embrace of the forest, the sun is still hovering above the horizon, in an eternal day.</p>
