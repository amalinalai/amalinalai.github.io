	<h1>Quantum Hub's Dungeons & Dragons West Marches Campaign</h1>
	
	<h2 id="bulletin">Creating (The Skeleton of) Your Character</h2>
	<div class="text-content">
	<p>There's no fixed way to create your character! You may start with a character concept & background first and then try to fit that into the game mechanics. However, the following  approach is generally how I do it and what I think is the easiest way for new players to begin crafting a character. This should provide a good starting point and will allow us to speed up the finalization of your character during our first session.</p>
	
	<p>Do note that I have simplified the character creation for this campaign to be more welcoming to new players, so if you are an experienced player you may notice some things missing.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Step 1: Choose a Class</h3>
	
	<div class="text-content">
	<p>Your character's class determines a large portion of your character's abilities. For example, certain classes will allow you to cast spells, while others will allow you to be better at melee rather than ranged combat. Within each class, there are also subclasses. Certain classes will require you to pick a subclass at first level, while others will come later.</p>
	
	<p>All of you will start at level 1, and as you play, your character will level up and unlock more skills and abilities. For this campaign, the following are the allowed classes. You may read through them and pick one for your character.</p>

	<!-- BARBARIAN -->
	<details>
		<summary>Barbarian</summary>
		<p>The defining feature of a barbarian is its presence. The mere presence of a barbarian in a fight can greatly swing the outcome. Barbarians only ever have 1 real ability, their rage. Most of their abilities and perks merely add on to their rage, making them more fearsome while raging. Thus, barbarians are always a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.</p>

	<b>Build Showcase #1: Berserker</b>
	<p>Beast is a 5th level berserker wearing a chain shirt and wielding a greataxe. Standing at a cliff edge and seeing the battle below, Beast decides to leap straight off the cliff to land in the fray. Typically, a fall from 50 feet would result in 5d10 bludgeoning damage, however Beast activates his <b>Frenzy</b> as he falls, instead receiving only half damage from the fall. Now in the midst of battle, he can attack up to 3 times per turn, each attack dealing 1d12 slashing damage. As he beats back wave after wave of foot soldiers, Beast eventually notices a fireball spell being flung towards him. His <b>Danger Sense</b> grants him advantage on the Dexterity saving throw to half the incoming damage, so he manages to escape relatively unscathed. As his rage runs its course, he gains one level of exhaustion, imposing disadvantage on all ability checks. He recognises that the time has come to retreat, and he thus leaves the fight with a trail of blood behind him.</p>

	<b>Build Showcase #2: Eagle Totem Warrior</b>
	<p>Akela is a 5th level totem warrior, wielding a greatsword and wearing no armor. She has embraced the eagle as her spirit animal and is currently tracking down bandits in the forest with her party. As they try to discern the bandits’ whereabouts, Akela sits down and prepares a simple ritual: <i>speak with animals</i>. She asks the birds and the deer whether they had seen bandits in these woods, and they point her in the right direction. As they near the bandit camp, they are spotted by a lookout. Quickly, Akela enters her <b>Rage</b> and uses the <b>Eagle</b>’s ability to Dash as a bonus action, granting her a whopping 80 ft of movement for the turn, allowing her to immediately catch the lookout. Akela then proceeds to use her action to make a <b>Reckless Attack</b>, believing that successfully connecting her attack would finish the bandit off. She makes her first attack with advantage and her second attack with no advantage, finishing off the bandit before he could make sue of the advantage he would have had on attacks against Akela. With this, Akela calls the rest of her party over and they proceed into the bandit camp with caution.</p>

		<summary>Cleric</summary>
		<p>Clerics in traditional RPGs are usually healers and supports, but in DnD Clerics can fill a wide variety of roles, depending on the god they draw their power from. Using divine magic, clerics have one of the most diverse subclasses, second only to wizards. Clerics are also defined by their deity, since different deities correspond to different divine domains.</p>

	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Knowledge</td>
	<td>
	Knowledge clerics focus on learning and gaining information, as information about the enemy can be your strongest weapon. Their domain spells focus around the mind, being able to influence the minds of others and being able to receive prophetic visions. At 1st level, they receive <strong>Blessings of Knowledge</strong>, giving them expertise with ability checks related to knowledge. Their new <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option at 2nd level is <strong>Knowledge of the Ages</strong>, granting them proficiency in a skill or tool they would otherwise not have.
	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Nature</td>
	<td>
	Nature clerics use the powers of the natural world such as using animals and plants to protect allies and defeat foes. Their domain spells focus on utility, from gaining information through animal allies, to changing the battlefield&rsquo;s terrain to their own advantage. At 1st level, as an <strong>Acolyte of Nature</strong>, nature clerics can learn a druid cantrip to add to their utility. At 2nd level, their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> options include <strong>Charm Animals and Plants</strong>: coercing nearby plants and animals into being charmed by the cleric.

At 2nd level, the storm cleric&rsquo;s damage output increases further with their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option: <strong>Destructive Wrath</strong>, causing their lightning or thunder damage to deal maximum damage rather than having to roll.
	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Trickery</td>

At 2nd level, their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option is to <strong>Invoke Duplicity</strong>, creating an illusory copy of themselves.

	<b>Build Showcase #1: Light Domain</b>
	<p>Ander is a 5th level light cleric who serves under Freyr, the Vanir god of the sun, wearing a chain shirt and wielding a simple mace and shield. As his allies get surrounded by a horde of zombies, Ander raises his shield bearing the symbol of his deity and speaks a holy prayer, using his <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> to <strong>Turn Undead</strong>. Most of the zombies are turned to dust by the divine energy, while the few that remain flee from Ander&rsquo;s shield. As his allies chase down and finish off the zombies, Ander's attention turns to the zombie warlock that resisted the turning effect. Before the warlock can launch its <em>eldritch blast</em> spell at one of his allies, Ander uses his reaction to create a <strong>Warding Flare</strong>, causing the warlock to miss its attack. Calling for his allies to stand back, Ander finally casts a <em>fireball</em> spell to deal 8d6 fire damage and burn the warlock's body, leaving nothing but ashes behind.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<b>Build Showcase #2: Tempest Domain</b>
	<p>Ignatius is a 5th level tempest cleric whose deity is Thor, Aesir god of thunder. He wears full chain mail and swings a large warhammer. When faced with overwhelming odds, Ignatius quickly casts <em>fog cloud</em> to obscure the vision of his enemies and allies alike, allowing his party members to beat a hasty retreat. As they turn to run, a lucky swing of a sword lands against Ignatius&rsquo; back, dealing minor damage. With his reaction, Ignatius uses the <strong>Wrath of the Storm</strong> to launch a bolt of lightning back towards his attacker, dealing 2d8 lightning damage. While arrows whiz past their heads, Ignatius&rsquo; party draws their pursuers into a narrow corridor. Here, Ignatius whips around and casts <em>thunderwave</em>, pushing all their pursuers back to create some breathing room for his party&rsquo;s spellcasters. While the spell usually deals 2d8 thunder damage, Ignatius uses his <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> to invoke his deity&rsquo;s <strong>Destructive Wrath</strong>, dealing 16 thunder damage to all enemies instead.</p>
