	<h2 id="bulletin">Creating (The Skeleton of) Your Character</h2>
	<div class="text-content">
	<p>There's no fixed way to create your character! You may start with a character concept & background first and then try to fit that into the game mechanics. However, the following  approach is generally how I do it and what I think is the easiest way for new players to begin crafting a character. This should provide a good starting point and will allow us to speed up the finalization of your character during our first session.</p>
	
	<p>Do note that I have simplified the character creation for this campaign to be more welcoming to new players, so if you are an experienced player you may notice some things missing.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Step 1: Choose a Class</h3>
	
	<div class="text-content">
	<p>Your character's class determines a large portion of your character's abilities. For example, certain classes will allow you to cast spells, while others will allow you to be better at melee rather than ranged combat. Within each class, there are also subclasses. Certain classes will require you to pick a subclass at first level, while others will come later.</p>
	
	<p>All of you will start at level 1, and as you play, your character will level up and unlock more skills and abilities. For this campaign, the following are the allowed classes. You may read through them and pick one for your character.</p>

	<!-- BARBARIAN -->
	<details>
		<summary class="outer-summary">Barbarian</summary>
		<p>The defining feature of a barbarian is its presence. The mere presence of a barbarian in a fight can greatly swing the outcome. Barbarians only ever have 1 real ability, their rage. Most of their abilities and perks merely add on to their rage, making them more fearsome while raging. Thus, barbarians are always a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.</p>

	<td>
	Berserkers use their rage as a means to an end, that end being violence. These barbarians often leave nothing more than bloodstains in their wake, becoming forces of destruction that both friends and foes avoid. Berserkers are characterised by their ability to enter a <strong>Frenzy</strong>, a special type of rage that grants them an additional weapon attack as a bonus action every turn. This power comes with a steep cost, inflicting exhaustion on the berserker after the frenzy ends. Exhaustion is a serious status ailment that can quickly lead to death; thus, berserkers must use their frenzy with caution. At higher levels, berserkers can frighten nearby enemies as well as retaliate against enemies that strike them.</td></tr>
	<tr>
	
	<td>Totem Warrior</td>
	<td>
	Totem warriors see rage as a spiritual experience, usually a blessing granted to them by a spirit animal. Totem warriors receive bonuses depending on the spirit animal they choose, with some totem warriors have multiple spirit animals. Being <strong>Spirit Seekers</strong>, totem warriors can cast spells like <em>beast sense</em> and <em>speak with animals</em> as rituals to seek guidance from their spirit animal. They invoke the blessings of a <strong>Totem Spirit</strong>, choosing one of 3 animals as their totem spirit. The blessing of the <strong>Bear</strong> grants resistance to all types of damage except psychic damage while raging. The blessing of the <strong>Eagle</strong> allows the totem warrior to Dash as a bonus action and gives other creatures disadvantage on opportunity attacks against them while raging. The blessing of the <strong>Wolf</strong> grants advantage to allies of the totem warrior who are attacking enemies that are adjacent to the totem warrior. At higher levels, more bonuses are available such as the bear totem inflicting disadvantage on enemy attacks, the eagle granting temporary flight, and the wolf allowing the totem warrior to knock enemies prone.</tr>

	Life clerics are similar to clerics in traditional RPGs, serving a more supportive role in the party. Their domain spells include healing and buff spells that keep their party members healthy and free from status ailments. From 1st level they have access to <strong>Disciple of Life</strong>, making their healing spells more potent. At 2nd level, they gain access to a new <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option: <strong>Preserve Life</strong>. This ability allows the cleric to perform an emergency mass heal to severely injured allies around them.</td></tr>

	<td>Light</td>
	<td>
	Light clerics focus on ranged damage dealing, with a focus on fire and radiant damage. Their domain spells take them on the offensive, enabling high damage and good crowd control. At 1st level, they can use a <strong>Warding Flare</strong> to momentarily blind an enemy, giving them disadvantage on the attack. At 2nd level, they gain the <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option: <strong>Radiance of the Dawn</strong>, dispelling magical darkness and dealing radiant damage to all around them.
	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Knowledge</td>
	<td>
	Knowledge clerics focus on learning and gaining information, as information about the enemy can be your strongest weapon. Their domain spells focus around the mind, being able to influence the minds of others and being able to receive prophetic visions. At 1st level, they receive <strong>Blessings of Knowledge</strong>, giving them expertise with ability checks related to knowledge. Their new <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option at 2nd level is <strong>Knowledge of the Ages</strong>, granting them proficiency in a skill or tool they would otherwise not have.
	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Nature</td>
	<td>
	Nature clerics use the powers of the natural world such as using animals and plants to protect allies and defeat foes. Their domain spells focus on utility, from gaining information through animal allies, to changing the battlefield&rsquo;s terrain to their own advantage. At 1st level, as an <strong>Acolyte of Nature</strong>, nature clerics can learn a druid cantrip to add to their utility. At 2nd level, their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> options include <strong>Charm Animals and Plants</strong>: coercing nearby plants and animals into being charmed by the cleric.
	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Tempest</td>
	<td>
	Tempest clerics channel the power of storms to rebuke their enemies and protect their allies. Their domain spells focus on controlling the battlefield, obscuring allies in fog or pushing enemies away from them. From 1st level storm clerics can invoke the <strong>Wrath of the Storm</strong> to deal lightning or thunder damage to their attackers. At 2nd level, the storm cleric&rsquo;s damage output increases further with their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option: <strong>Destructive Wrath</strong>, causing their lightning or thunder damage to deal maximum damage rather than having to roll.
	</td></tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>Trickery</td>
	<td>
	Trickery clerics utilise illusory magic and the manipulation of shadows to sow discord into the world. Their domain spells create illusions and enchantments to beguile the minds of their enemies. At 1st level, they can grant the <strong>Blessing of the Trickster</strong>, allowing them to conceal their allies more effectively. At 2nd level, their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> option is to <strong>Invoke Duplicity</strong>, creating an illusory copy of themselves. This double can cast spells and create distractions, allowing the cleric an advantage in combat.
	</td></tr>

	<td>War</td>
	<td>
	War clerics focus on charging into the fray and using brute force to carve a path through their foes. Their domain spells grant them increased survivability as well as bonus damage to their melee strikes. From 1st level, they are <strong>War Priest</strong>s, which grant them additional attacks at the cost of a bonus action. At 2nd level, their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> grants them supernatural accuracy for their melee attacks in the form of a <strong>Guided Strike</strong>.

	Battlemasters play similarly to many traditional RPG warriors, where they have a myriad of special attacks that inflict conditions on their enemies. Their entire kit from 3<sup>rd</sup> level to 20<sup>th</sup> is centred around their 3<sup>rd</sup> level ability: <strong>Combat Superiority</strong>, giving them maneuvers that modify their attacks by increasing the damage and creating special effects. These effects range from disarming the enemy, to tripping them, to even taunting them. Some maneuvers afford additional team utility, allowing battlemasters to &ldquo;give&rdquo; one of their attacks to a teammate.</td></tr>

	<td>Champion</td>
	<td>
	Champions are the most basic fighter subclass, with all of the abilities gained from this subclass being passive abilities. This is characterised by their 3rd level ability: <strong>Improved Critical</strong>, allowing them to land a critical hit on a roll of either 19 or 20, whereas other classes can only land a critical hit on a roll of 20. At later levels, Champions can raise their critical chance even higher or gain passive health regeneration.</tr>
	</td>
	
	<td>Eldritch Knight</td>
	<td>
	Eldritch knights combine arcane magic and martial weapons, making them useful in a wide variety of situations. Eldritch knights borrow from the wizard&rsquo;s spell list with their 3<sup>rd</sup> level ability: <strong>Spellcasting</strong>, which gives them access to the same spell list as a wizard, but with much fewer spell slots. By supplementing their already high survivability with defensive spells, eldritch knights can become immovable walls. Additionally, they can learn powerful offensive spells that can clear a room in moments. However, knowing when to spend your resources is especially important for an eldritch knight. Do you spend your spell slot to fling a fireball? Or attack with your weapon instead and save the spell slot for defense?</tr>

	<td>
	Ancients paladins are guardians of the natural order, defending the wild places of the world from forces that wish to corrupt the light. Sworn to protect life and beauty, the oath of the ancients binds paladins to the tenets of kindling the light, sheltering the light and being the light in the world. Their oath spells exhibit their connection to nature and fey, being mainly control and utility spells. Their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> has 2 options: <strong>Nature&rsquo;s Wrath</strong> causes spectral vines to constrict the target and <strong>Turn the Faithless</strong> causes fey and fiends alike to flee from the paladin. At higher levels, ancients paladins protect their allies from magic damage and can become more effective spellcasters.</td></tr>

	<td>
	Devotion paladins are similar to the depiction of paladins in most RPGs, upstanding warriors who defend the innocent and act with honor. Bright bulwarks who stand against evil, the oath of devotion binds the paladin to the tenets of honesty, courage, compassion, honor and duty. Their oath spells reflect their desire to defend the weak, being mainly defensive spells. They have 2 <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> options: <strong>Sacred Weapon</strong> imbues a melee weapon with magic, causing it to glow and deal increased damage per hit, and <strong>Turn the Unholy</strong> causes undead and fiends to flee from the paladin. At higher levels, devotion paladins can protect their allies from being charmed and glow with holy radiance to deal radiant damage.</tr>
	</td>
	
	<td>Vengeance</td>
	<td>
	Vengeance paladins will stop at nothing to enact their vengeance against the evils of the world. Brutal dark avengers, the oath of vengeance calls for no mercy for the wicked and for vengeance to be carried out by any means necessary. This is seen in their oath spells which focus on offensive spells and debuffs. Their <strong>Channel Divinity</strong> options are <strong>Abjure Enemy</strong> which causes a target to become frightened and be unable to move, as well as <strong>Vow of Enmity</strong> which grants advantage to all attack rolls against a single enemy. At higher levels, vengeance paladins are able to chase their enemies down more easily as well as gain flight and an aura of fear.</tr>

	<h3>Step 2: Choose a Race</h3>
	
	<h3>Step 3: Assign Your Ability Score</h3>
	<p>There are six ability scores: <b>Strength, Wisdom, Constitution, Intelligence, Dexterity</b> and <b>Charisma</b>. They describe different aspects of your character, and range from 0 to 20, with a score of 10 to 11 being the normal human average.</p>
	<p>Ability scores are central to the main rolling mechanic of DnD. The higher the ability score, the higher your ability score modifier. This modifier often gets added to your d20 (20-sided dice) rolls; a higher modifier thus gives you greater advantage in getting higher roll outcomes.</p>
	<p>This modifier is calculated by subtracting 10 from the ability score, and then dividing by 2, rounded down. I.e. [#-10]/2 rounded down. (Yes, it can be negative!)</p>
	<p>For this game, we will use standard array of ability score values:<b>15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8</b>. Assign them each to one ability score according to how you see fit. Afterwards, add the additional ability score modifiers given by your chosen race. This will be your final ability score for now!</p>
	<p>As a note, the class descriptions above will indicate what ability score your class predominantly uses for rolls, but don't worry about making your character the most optimal one! If a certain assignment fits better for a story, or background you have in mind for your character, go for it!</p>
	
	<h3>Step 4: Filling Out a Backstory</h3>
	<p>DnD is a roleplaying game after all — you're playing a character in a world! Think about your character's place in the setting, and what kind of person they are. Here are some guiding questions you should answer:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is their name?</li>
		<li>What did they do before they joined the Hielaphites? What is their history?</li>
		<li>Why did they decide to join the Hielaphites and go adventuring?</li>
		<li> Personality: what are 2 positive and 2 negative traits?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You don't have to stop here. If you have more ideas, feel free to write to your heart's content and flesh out the character you've just built.</p>
	
	<h3>Step 4: Sending The Details to Your DM</h3>
	Now just put them all together in a message or document, and send it over to your DM (me, Amalina). :) Check that you've included:
	<ul>
		<li>Your class</li>
		<li>Your chosen subclass / spells if relevant to your chosen class; it should be specified at the end of the class description if you need to pick them</li>
		<li>Your race</li>
		<li>Ability score distribution (incl. bonus from race)</li>
		<li>Name, backstory and personality traits</li>
	</ul>
