	<h1>Quantum Hub's Dungeons & Dragons West Marches Campaign</h1>
	<div class="text-content">
	<blockquote><i>Last updated: 19 July 2023</i></blockquote>
	<p><b>Dungeon Master(s) [DM]:</b> Amalina</p>
	<p>Due to the large number of interested players, I cannot run a normal game with all players in the same session as it is too difficult for me to manage everyone at the same time. Thus I have chosen to run a West Marches campaign. The idea is simple: the <b>players decide the time, party (group of players you go on the adventure with) and the direction of the adventure</b>. Because of this, the players within each session can be different and flexible. Read on to see how this format works!</p>

	<h2 id="start">Starting your Next Adventure</h2>
	<h3>Your First Session</h3>
	<div class="text-content">
	<ol>
		<li>Read through <a href="#setting">Setting</a> and the first request on <a href="#bulletin">Bulletin Board</a>.</li>
		<li>Create a basic outline for your D&D character following the <a href="cc.html">Character Creation page</a>.</li>
		<li>Send your character outline to your DM to look through before your first session.</li>
		<li>Organize a party of <b>3 to 5 people</b> to do the first request. I recommend this to be done in the group chat.</li>
		<li>Decide on the date and time of your first session with your DM.</li> 
	</ol>
	
	<p>During the first session, we will polish up your character creation and play your first quest!</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Subsequent Sessions</h3>
	<div class="text-content">
	<ol>
		<li>Pick a request from the <a href="#bulletin">Bulletin Board</a>.</li>
		<li>Organize a party of <b>3 to 5 people</b> to tackle this request together.</li>
		<li>Inform your DM <b>at least 1 week in advance</b>.</li>
		<li>Decide on the date and time of your first session with your DM.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Additional notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>While the party is flexible and up to you to decide, do try to include everyone when deciding your party for various sessions.</li>
		<li>Adventures not on the bulletin board can be proposed to the DM with a good reason to tackle them.</li>
		<li>Any adventure idea can be vetoed by the DM if they don't think its worth a session.</li>
		<li>Levels and loot come with adventuring. More sessions = more loot and levelling up to progress your character.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="text-content">
	<p>To you, home is the safety within gleaming walls of metal alloy sheets, rusting screws that hold it into place, backed by layers of concrete and soil â€” here you are protected, you live in pleasant harmony with the rest of your community. And yet, home is the suffocating grasp on you as familiar faces begin to blur and amalgate as they pass you again for the hundredth time that day â€” here you are like a bird snipped of it's wings. But, what is a bird?</p>
	
	<p>Some words merely register as images in a picture book, or worse, letters on a page; you know not what the smell of rain is like, the feel of a winter's breeze on your skin, or the sound of a lion's roar. Nobody does. Not for almost two hundred years.</p>
	
	<p>The Fog had made sure of that. It descended on earth without warning, devouring everything in its way, leaving nothing but flames in its wake. Or so the records say. Some kingdoms managed to take refuge, just as yours had. In the depths of earth, your kingdom, Linde, found safety in isolation. Underground, nothing could reach you. Not even the deadly radiation that had burned all who could not understand it. But what lies above ground? As the Fog begins to clear, and radiation levels begin to dip, a new rank of townsfolk has been identified: <i>Hielaphites</i>, capable of withstanding the conditions above ground unlike the others.</p>
	
	<p>Now, dear Hielaphite, it is your time to forge your own path, a pioneer walking the lands long forgotten, amidst dangers unknown. What will you do? And what will drive you, push you above the limits of your fears and weaknesses?</p>
	
	<blockquote><b>TL;DR / Simplified:</b> 200 years ago, The Fog had destroyed everything on earth with radiation ravaging everything above ground. Your kingdom, Linde, managed to seek refuge in underground bunkers. The Fog has just begun to clear, and it seems as though a group of townsfolk, known as <i>Hielaphites</i>, have a mutation that allows them to uniquely withstand the high radiation levels above ground and walk amidst The Fog. You are one such person, and now you have decided to join and become the pioneering batch of explorers for your kingdom.</blockquote>

	<b>INVESTIGATION REQUEST.</b><br>
	<b>THREAT LEVEL:</b> LOW <br>
	<p>About 80 years ago, for unknown reasons, the ground caved in, causing destruction to our bunker structure and blocking the corridor leading towards what used to be the East Wing of Linde. As a result, we completely lost contact with about 40 people of our community then, with no way of reaching out to them. Requesting Hielaphites to reach the East Wing over land to investigate and report back on number of survivors, if any.
