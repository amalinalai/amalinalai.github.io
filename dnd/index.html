	<h1>Quantum Hub's Dungeons & Dragons Campaign</h1>
	
	<h2 id="start">Let's Play!</h2>
	<div class="text-content">
	<p>Hello, thank you for your interest in playing D&D! Due to the large number of interested players, I cannot run a regular campaign as it will be too difficult for me to manage all players at the same time. If the number of players still interested in this after Session 1 drops to 5 & below, I will convert this into a regular campaign. Otherwise, I will continue to do a West Marches style campaign, for which I will explain the rules in-depth next time and update this page! :-)</p>
	
	<p>For now, do not worry. In preparation for your first session, please do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Read through <a href="#setting">Setting</a> and the first request on <a href="#bulletin">Bulletin Board</a>.</li>
		<li>Create a basic outline for your D&D character following the <a href="cc.html">Character Creation page</a>.</li>
		<li>Send your character outline to me (Amalina!) to look through before your first session.</li>
		<li>Organize a group of 5 people maximum (known as a 'party') to do the first quest. Decide on the date, time and let me know. This will be your first session! Recommended to do this in our group chat.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>During the first session, we will polish up your character creation and play your first quest!</p>

	<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
	<div class="text-content">
	<p>To you, home is the safety within gleaming walls of metal alloy sheets, rusting screws that hold it into place, backed by layers of concrete and soil — here you are protected, you live in pleasant harmony with the rest of your community. And yet, home is the suffocating grasp on you as familiar faces begin to blur and amalgate as they pass you again for the hundredth time that day — here you are like a bird snipped of it's wings. But, what is a bird?</p>
	
	<p>Some words merely register as images in a picture book, or worse, letters on a page; you know not what the smell of rain is like, the feel of a winter's breeze on your skin, or the sound of a lion's roar. Nobody does. Not for almost two hundred years.</p>
	
	<p>The Fog had made sure of that. It descended on earth without warning, devouring everything in its way, leaving nothing but flames in its wake. Or so the records say. Some kingdoms managed to take refuge, just as yours had. In the depths of earth, your kingdom, Linde, found safety in isolation. Underground, nothing could reach you. Not even the deadly radiation that had burned all who could not understand it. But what lies above ground? As the Fog begins to clear, and radiation levels begin to dip, a new rank of townsfolk has been identified: <i>Hielaphites</i>, capable of withstanding the conditions above ground unlike the others.</p>
	
	<p>Now, dear Hielaphite, it is your time to forge your own path, a pioneer walking the lands long forgotten, amidst dangers unknown. What will you do? And what will drive you, push you above the limits of your fears and weaknesses?</p>
	
	<blockquote><b>TL;DR / Simplified:</b> 200 years ago, The Fog had destroyed everything on earth with radiation ravaging everything above ground. Your kingdom, Linde, managed to seek refuge in underground bunkers. The Fog has just begun to clear, and it seems as though a group of townsfolk, known as <i>Hielaphites</i>, have a mutation that allows them to uniquely withstand the high radiation levels above ground and walk amidst The Fog. You are one such person, and now you have been pushed to become the pioneering batch of explorers for your kingdom.</blockquote>

	<b>INVESTIGATION REQUEST.</b><br>
	<b>THREAT LEVEL:</b> LOW <br>
	<p>About 80 years ago, for unknown reasons, the ground caved in, causing destruction to our bunker structure and blocking the corridor leading towards what used to be the East Wing of Linde. As a result, we completely lost contact with about 40 people of our community then, with no way of reaching out to them. Requesting Hielaphites to reach the East Wing over land to investigate and report back on number of survivors, if any.
