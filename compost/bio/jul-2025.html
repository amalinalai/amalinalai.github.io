	  <h1>January 2024</h1>
	  <p>I am a PhD student and recipient of the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/financialmatters/scholarships/npgs">Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship</a> at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/">Mile Gu</a>. I work on mathematical tools for continuous variable quantum information processing.</p>
	
	<p>I am currently on a 6-month sabbatical until November 2025, working as an editorial intern at World Scientific Publishing.</p>
	
	<p>When I'm not working (on science), I am part of the <a href="https://www.theslowpresszine.com/">The Slow Press</a> — an independent zine interested in looking at stories surrounding food — as their Assistant Lead Design. Find my portfolio for this <a href="/tsp">here</a>. Apart from that, I currently run a small independent business selling doc templates for writers.</p>
	
	<p>I am interested in pop culture analysis, the interconnected nature of the world, and what makes for effective pedagogy. I also enjoy looking at & making art, reading & writing, and working out. These days, I've been occupying my free time with sudoku.</p>
