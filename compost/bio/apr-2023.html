	  <h1>April 2023</h1>
	  <p>I am a new PhD student and recipient of the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/financialmatters/scholarships/npgs">Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship</a> at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/">Mile Gu</a>.
	Currently, my research interests lie in continuous variable systems and (virtual) resource distillation. I am also interested in what makes for effective pedagogy, and enjoy teaching and communicating scientific information.</p>
	
	<p>Outside of physics, I am interested in pop-culture analysis, brutalist web design, and the ways in which we collect information from seemingly disparate fields that interconnect to provide us with a toolset to encounter the world. When I'm not working on science, I am part of the <a href="https://www.theslowpresszine.com/">The Slow Press</a> — an independent zine interested in looking at stories surrounding food — as their Assistant Lead Design. Find my portfolio for this <a href="/tsp">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I also enjoy looking at art, drawing and (amateur) birding in my free time.</p>
