	  <h1>January 2024</h1>
	  <p>I am a PhD student and recipient of the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/financialmatters/scholarships/npgs">Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship</a> at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/">Mile Gu</a>.
	Currently, my research interests lie in mathematical tools and techniques continuous variable quantum information processing.</p>
	
	<p>Outside of physics, I am interested in pop-culture analysis, brutalist web design, and the ways in which we collect information from seemingly disparate fields that interconnect to provide us with a toolset to encounter the world. I am also interested in what makes for effective pedagogy, and enjoy teaching and breaking down complex concepts into something more digestible for a wider audience.</p>
	
	<p>When I'm not working on science, I am part of the <a href="https://www.theslowpresszine.com/">The Slow Press</a> ‚Äî an independent zine interested in looking at stories surrounding food ‚Äî as their Assistant Lead Design. Find my portfolio for this <a href="/tsp">here</a>. Apart from that, I currently run a small independent business selling doc templates for writers.</p>
	
	<p>In my free time, I like looking at & making art, reading & writing, and working out. I'm always looking to pick up new skills and the interests occupying my thoughts are in constant rotation. These days, I'm working on expanding my website, learning how to rollerskate and taking pictures of birds through a cheap pair of binoculars.</p>
