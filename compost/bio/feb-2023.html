	  <h1>February 2023</h1>
	  <p>I am a new PhD student and recipient of the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/financialmatters/scholarships/npgs">Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship</a> at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/">Mile Gu</a>.
	Currently, my research interests lie in continuous variable systems and (virtual) distillation, but I am also keen to learn more about error-correction.</p>
	<p>Outside of physics, I am interested in pop-culture analysis, brutalist web design, and the ways in which information from seemingly disparate fields interconnect to provide us with a toolset to encounter the world. I believe websites can be more than just professional, which is why this one houses a <a href="/precipice">personal</a> side. I also enjoy looking at art, drawing and (amateur) birding in my free time.</p>
