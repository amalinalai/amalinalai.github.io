	<p>You decide to head down towards the sandy path, the sun falling behind you. The ground crunches beneath you as the grassy lands grow sparse.</p>
	<p>What hits you first is the sound of water against land and rock, so very faint but audible enough that you've picked it up. Then, it is the smell of salt in the air. And finally, as you round a particularly sharp corner the beach comes into view, ocean glistening under the sunlight.</p>

	<summary>Move towards the water?</summary>
	<p>You move forward until the cold waves are lapping at your feet, and the wet sand shifts about you as the ocean pulls itself back, before crashing back onto shore again. Here as you stand, the ocean calls and beckons you to watch its eternal dance, a hypnotic trance that devours the passing of time. There is nothing to see at the horizon; just a single line that divides sky from ocean that seems to stretch to infinity.</p>
	<p>You're not quite sure how long you stand there, just looking out to the deep blue.<p>

	<summary>Sit in the sand?</summary>
	<p>You head towards a patch of dry sand, settling yourself on the soft, warm granules. There are no trees here to shade you from the sun, but it doesn't scorch you as you think it might. Instead, it simply emanates a comforting warmth that convinces you to sit for awhile longer as you watch the waves from the distance.</p>
	<p>When you finally decide to get up, the sun has barely shifted, as though time itself has stretched to indulge you for a little while.</p>
