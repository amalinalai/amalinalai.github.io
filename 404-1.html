	<p>You should really brace yourself for a hard landing.</p>
	<p>Except â€” when you finally come into contact with solid ground, it is as though you had only made a small leap before landing. The soft blades of grass nestle beneath your feet. The air smells distinctly of fresh earth. Around you, you now note the lush forest that has seemingly sprung up out of nowhere.</p>

	<p>You feel the grain of dirt against your fingers, cool to touch. This close, you note the critters of the microbiomes hidden from plain sight in the soil, against the blooming wildflowers that have staked their claim on this plot of land.</p>

	<p>To your right, you can barely make out a sandy track in the ground.</p>
