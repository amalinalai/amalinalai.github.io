	<p>The expansive white stretches on before you for as far as the eye can see. The ground beneath you crunches gently with each step, and as your gaze is greeted is with even more white at every turn you make, it occurs to you that <i>you are lost.</i></p>
	<p>There is one thing, though. On the ground before you, a hole that leads downwards, roughly large enough for you to fit.</p>
	<details>
	<summary>Peer into the hole?</summary>
	<p>You peer into its dark depths, but you can't tell where it leads to. It seems to go on for miles and miles, burrowing into the center of the earth.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/404-1.html">Jump into the hole.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/">Turn back and head home.</a></p>
